"Walk the halls of the hospital and you will see empty tables, full waiting rooms and long lines for the pharmacy.    If you need an appointment, you will spend 6 hours on hold, waiting to speak to someone (my line call number was  63). 

They call screener you do talk with may or may not get you an appointment but rest assured, it won't be for 90 days.  If a nurse calls you, they will tell you how much they regret how frustrating your experience has been and then won't call you back to get that specialist scheduled (4 months now). 

If you do get an appointment, it may get canceled a day prior and IF they call to inform you of that, will have to wait another 90 days to see a doctor.  

When I've had to go into the VA, I've never seen a specialist or an employee that didn't wreak of one of many smoke breaks.  These are medical professionals/doctors supposed to support (not baby), the men and women who have ""born the brunt of war"".  Sure.   

The relationship the Portland VA has with OHSU is to bring over college students to practice on the Veteran.  Ask for an actual Doctor.   You may not know until they stab through your bursa sack or remove the wrong tooth. 

They block treating Veterans by being disrespectful and mean and the people that take complaints are just as unhelpful.  Additionally, there seems to be a heavy bias toward a belief system that's irrelevant but obviously important to the open public spaces/behind desks of VA employees.  

The VA in Portland and it's extensions, seem to be full of entitled government leeches who dislike the vet or their job, perhaps both.  

I'm sure good people work here and I've met a few but they seem to be in the minority.",negative
"There are many talented, intelligent hard working people at the VA.

After a probationary year, employees can't be fired and it shows.

There is a great case of disorganization and ""slacking"".
It's like a big tanker being run by sloths.  Things are SLOW. People put in minimal effort at times.

Veterans and even hard working employees are frustrated by VA culture.  It's too bad. Veterans deserve top care and don't always get it at the VA.

The VA is where people go ""out to pasture.""  The VA is where professional dreams go to die.",negative
"Too bad I cannot give zero, or minus stars.  I am startled at what is either incompetence or lack of caring/empathy...or both.  I have met two (2) medical professionals at this VA who seem to have their heads on straight...the others I have encountered make me wonder if the Marques de Sade opened schools of medicine and from where these uncaring people graduated.
When I was 18 the nation called for its young men to join, or be drafted...we went and now we are ignored.  I have used one other VA facility and it was fantastic, but this place is, in my opinion, becoming a dangerous place!",negative
"The bedside manner of a number of nurses employed for the VA Hospital are less than desirable at this establishment. My dad has been staying here the last few days and his current room shares a bathroom. I needed to utilize the facility in order to urinate and I was walked in on by the nurse. In a really irritated tone she LOUDLY (enough for my elderly/hard of hearing father to clearly hear) chastised me on the policy regarding visitors only using the public restrooms/patients only in the room(s). I was so humiliated and ashamed I left in tears. Aside from having to constantly remind them to change his bandages, clothes, etc. is in and of itself horrible when it comes to the nursing care but the plain MANNERS of those that I have interacted with are just disgusting. I expected so much better for those that administer care to our veterans and their families, how sad.",negative
"The ER is among the worst ERs I have ever experienced. That's including ERs in 3rd world countries. Staff is condescending to everyone that asks a question and I think that's to cover up the fact that 99.9% of them are horribly incompetent. It's either that or they all forgot the oaths they swore when becoming healthcare ""professionals."" I've never met more disgraces to healthcare professionals anywhere in my life.",negative
"I'd give it a minus if I could. Portland Oregon VA hospital is the worst in the nation.. If your 15 min late for an appt they cancel it... but they can make you wait in the germ pond for well over 2 hours to be seen at your scheduled appt... then it always take at least 2 hours to get your travel pay... The logistical staff members are the rudest group of assholes I've ever encountered at a hospital.... 
Every experience at the portland oregon va medical center is a new experience in the SUCK!!!!! Always get the shitty treatment there..... 
My recommendation is to die on the streets or find a different hospital for your ailments. .....",negative
unfortunately this is the nastiest hospital we have had the misfortune to be in. the floors are filty in the bathroom with  dirt slung up the walls. this may explain why our family member contracted mrsa from this facility.  it took nine days to start appropriate diet and twice daily dressing changes to wound were only done three times in a week. because of their lack of good care a part of a foot had to be amputated. whenever you speak with staff you get a deer in the headlight look and nothing is followed through on. it would be much better to dissolve va and pay to put patients in public hospitals. they deserve better care even if our government doesn't think so. which is obvious by their treatment of vets.,negative
"Terrible service. Waited for over an hour and they weren't busy in the emergency room at 6 PM on Saturday. I see a single nurse, doctor or physicians assistant. Only time I saw somebody took my vitals initially. I have a fever, cough, and major signs of COVID-19. So you would think they would want to see me immediately. Do you not go here. Go to a regular hospital",negative
"Another horrendous day at the VA, this time at the pharmacy pick-up window. This system needs to change ASAP!!!!
You can't people shouting out the medications to the window representative, that is highly private information. Where is the confidentiality in having other patients knowing what your illness is because you have to yell through a thick plexiglass window at pharmacy rep. who never seems to know what is going on!!!",negative
This hospital has been my hospital since I got out of the Marine Corps. I've always been taken care but unfortunately the one star is because of the front desk lady that gave me an attitude when I tried to check in along with two other veterans who tried to get help. I understand these clerks deal with a lot of vets but there are better ways to treat people. I was sick as a dog trying to get assistance and she kept asking me the same questions about my symptoms as if I were lying with a nasty attitude. We served this country honorably and this not the way to treat our veterans. Every time I walk into this hospital it's depressing. I see veterans being abandoned waiting without a nurse or anyone on sight to check if they're alright. We definitely need to do better for our vets it's depressing to see how some of these guys are treated after giving everything they have to this country.,negative
God this place is simply awful. I wouldn't wish this treatment on my worst enemy. I really wish politations and other Americans would care more about Veterans. Disgusting bathrooms. Fecal matter all over the toilet and walls. Filthy. Its an absolute dump. Its all we have. But until the veterans admin cleans up this place. Ugghhh. I pray that this place gets a full overhaul. In the meantime I guess I'm stuck going to this awful place.,negative
"The absolute worst hospital I have ever been to! Save yourself, your time and your money-GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! The Dr's are arrogant, rude  and do not treat the patients as they should especially for Veterans! They are not helpful at all unless you are dying as they mentioned. This is unfair, unprofessional and shameful to deal with sick individuals like this especially ones who serve our country.",negative
"I have been going here for 3years. Service is slow and everyone is rude no matter how hard you try to be nice. The wait is terrible even if you have an appointment so make sure you have the whole day free. 
That's just medical side

If you are trying to learn about claims or do anything with dental, eye glasses or anything else. I would also recommend going to a different location they are uneducated in the field they are in and will not give you the help you need. They act as if you owe them everything and that you are here to serve to there needs.",negative
Most of the doctors are great. Too much negative attitude from the civilian staff. They speak to you as if you are irritating them for asking simple questions. Anyone who attends this facility need to start getting names to head supervisors and above to help fix this issue. The bathrooms always have a foul odor and are not well kept.,negative
"I am currently admitted in the hospital due to a knee surgery.  This place truly terrifies me.  I'm not talking about the little stuff, such as bad food.  I'm talking about docs on call not returning phone calls.  Docs making me wait up to six hours for paid medication.  Doctors insisting I walk (weight bearing) on a walker the day after surgery.  This was because the docs knew the PT guys wouldn't see me on a Sunday.  I cried for hours after this from the pain.   This last surgery was to remove a 2+ cm tumor lodged into I think my femur.  Bone was removed, cadaver bone was used to replace, a steel plate and screws were added, this was a major knee surgery at nearly four hours.  

I've used VA hospitals since the 90's.  While some were very inefficient, I don't believe they were trying to do harm.  I truly believe the Miami VA Hospital is in such a rapid tizzy to have open beds, I would not be surprised if this policy killed patients (VETERANS).  Actually I would only be surprised if it didn't.  

On a bright side, The Fisher House is a Godsend.  I have not seen it personally, being dormant but my dad has been allowed to stay there since I was admitted, and he honestly loves it.  He is receiving such wonderful care.",negative
"Extremely rude and disrespectful receptionists who are clearly uneducated and do not give a damn about you or the rest of the veterans for that matter. Always miscommunication issues with calling in for general information or setting appointments. The doctors, nurses, etc. are great, no issues with them thus far... It's everyone else  you have to watch out for. Needs much improvement overall",negative
"Do not go to this hospital for any type of service. It's a shame, as Veterans, the type of medical treatment we receive. This place has no idea what medical treatment is and lack total compassion for the patient. They treat you as a guinea pig, then blame the patient when something goes wrong. These doctors, residents, interns only pass the buck with treatment. You spend a majority of the time explaining yourself, then downs the rest of the time trying to figure out what they are doing because they will NOT inform you. The term, ""the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing."" Disgusting is at best.",negative
"I used to go to this hospital,  but it was just too much of a hassle.  The wait times are crazy and the hospital itself is a zoo. It's always busy and the staff acts like the folks over at the dmv, they just don't care.  I will never go back. I'm done",negative
"Had a visit with a certain doctor, from the opening conversation, he was very condescending, My name is my name, refer to me as that our Sarge! Old man is not my Damn name!!! Luckily I had my medicine that day!!!",negative
"Some of the clinics are good, others are the worst. Specially the urinary and renal clinics. The resident doctors treat you like crap and make up lies to try and force you to have procedures for practice you don`t need. Some of the workers even tell you to read your medical reports, as they will surely mess you up in here. The ER room is the only good and caring department in the entire medical center. They always found out what was wrong with you in a few hours. If you go to other clinics, you can expect to almost die before they treat you..I was admitted a few times, and they never change the sheets or blankets or even offer some to you for your care.  If you don`t have your own clothing with you, you will be almost naked as they provide you hardly anything  to cover you up good. They never come around to bring you water other than when it is time for your meds you see a nurse.  The nurses cannot think for themselves, as they have to get permission for anything. I sure am sorry I never bought medicare when I could have, as now I am a dead duck thanks to the VA..",negative
"I had a great first impression, maybe because my mom joined. However, 5 years later I need to update this review. It's impossible to get an appointment. I will take you months and when you finally get there, YOU WAIT FOREVER! Then when you are finally seen, it's a nurse practitioner or a medschool student.  WHERE ARE THE ACTUAL DOCTORS!? I've never been able to actually sit down and discuss my injury with an orthopedic surgeon! That is insane especially considering my traumatic injuries where years ago. EVERYTIME you go to the VA, you have to take labs, WHICH RESULTS IN MORE WAITING. The Labs area is creepy too. Oh and while you do more waiting, you will be asked for money. ALOT! Panhandling is a huge problem at this VA and I've had to grab a security guard more than once because I didn't  feel safe at this VA

My advice, take a vacation day to do this.  You will be there for hours. 

The one star is for complementary valet parking for Veterans. This valet crew has always been nice and address me by mam; which is well mannered. However, after I asked for my parking validation and I was told that I couldn't have it, that it was only Validated for vets. I am a young looking female vet and have  been out for a few years. News flash, educate your staff that the FEMALE is the FUTURE VETERAN... like are you for real!!! WE ARE HERE NOW AND WE DEMAND QUALITY CARE. Its was extremely embarrassing when your staff demanded prof of my veteran status. Come on be better! 

I will be writing our state senator next. Trust & believe",negative
"This hospital is downright Dangerous.

Communication within this hospital to patients and between staff is a huge area of opportunity. I had a surgery on an infection on my hand. Upon releasing me from the hospital I was told someone would contact me. Many days later, when no one contacted me, I called the clinic and explained my story to maybe 2 dozen people, and that I have a large open wound with not enough supplies to continue dressing the wound. They told me to just see my primary care doctor in a few weeks. As it turns out, after dozens of phone calls and flagging down the borrowed surgeon from Northwestern Medical center for an improvised appointment, I was told that I had MRSA a contagious and dangerous infection. The hospital had no plans of telling me about this dangerous infection. The surgeon was appalled that no one followed up with me and that they would not schedule an appointment for me for weeks citing that the ""clinic was closed"" for nearly a half a month. Veterans, unfortunately, must be very careful with their life/health at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center.",negative
"This is directed to the ER staff. The nurses in triage and the entire hospital are the true heroes.  They put up with the most in my opinion. Actual patients, fake patients, fluids, smells, etc.  More importantly, they roll with the punches even if they come across a belligerent patient like myself. Yes I was in severe pain and they tried their best to keep me calm.  I was a dry-heaving, blood spitting, doubled over in pain arse. It hurt a lot.  Nurses? Calming and attending.  I was very angry at having to repeat myself to different people about where it hurts and what have I've been doing to get like this.  
I'm transferred to a ER bed waiting to see one of the doctors  in the station. He walks in with his shoulder-length George Clooney circa St. Elsewhere  hair and a aire of Mr. Cock and a
Walk . I snapped when he asked me what was wrong.  I told him i was in fucking pain, still,  and it seemed like no one gave a shit. His response was classic A-hole. ""I will not examine you if you curse at me"". Not cursing in general mind you, cursing at him. I just looked at him, shook my head then proceeded to get dressed. What an dickhead! I'm in physical pain ,writhing on the bed moaning for close to 3 hours and you won't examine me because I  said a bad word?  My colourfull verbiage is an assault to your delicate ears and constitution. Weeeeelllllllll F you and your ears and constitution. 
So if you work in ER at this particular VA Hospital,  please search out this doctor and ask him to read this. Can't miss him ABOUT 5 10 dick-ish.  Also have him watch the last week tonight w/John Oliver episode about gender and race disparities in Medicine. He just struck me as one of those doctors who really believes all of the outrageous  misconceptions that were discussed.  Don't worry though, I will be filing a complaint. Might i suggest a different line of work. Crash test dummy fuckface",negative
"The bathrooms at Jessie Brown are disgusting. What does it tell you when the floors are sticking to your shoes. Half the time they are out of paper.
You are looking at three hours some days to get your blood drawn.
Seven weeks to get eye glasses because you must go to the VA lab. To get glasses from America's Best no more then a week and mostly less then that
Over all the place needs better attention paid to cleaning. Janitors  take far too many breaks. 
Security allows anyone to come in for they do not check ID'S. The building where you would apply for a pension is must more secure then anywhere in the actual medical facility. Too many Residents and not enough Attendings. If you tell the resident you want an attending they have a bad attitude about that.",negative
"It is a VA Hospital. It's loud, chaotic and disheveled and that's just the staff. It smells, it seems that only 30% of the people in the hospital are actual patients, the rest are malingerers. Administratively it is a joke. However, once you get past all of that and finally get to see a doctor, tech, or social worker there is an 80% chance you'll get good service.",negative
"This is one of the most disgusting medical centers I have seen. As a veteran and citizen, it is disgraceful in the manner this institution is kept. Some of the examining rooms are so dirty one can see the dirt and splashes of blood on the walls and lower walls with open pipes. Ladies lounge, broken walls with open pipes, poorly kept commodes, floors needing repair. This is a slum landlord. The cafeteria is full of unhealthy food, lacks proper cleaning.  Part of the problem, some veterans need lessons in hygiene thus not doing their part in cleaning up after themselves. Who hires these people, what type of training and vetting is done? The CEO and staff are lazy, they do not care about these veterans. The so-called caring social services is a joke, they care nothing for the problems of the veterans, they are to busy caring about their positions. These people are always attending meetings, I see no obvious changes. What I see are people who have positions they are not entitled because they are not doing their job just waiting until the clock strikes for them to go home. They have horrific attitudes, terrible manners and lack good communication skills. Their presence is useless and ineffective. There are services veterans desperately need and are not getting because the staff avoids telling them what is available. Most of the doctors and nurses are truly dedicated and committed to giving good medical care. If you need to be admitted to this hospital, my suggestion, look for another location.  It is so dirty one can easily come down with an infection. If you must be admitted check out the hospital ward and staff. It is an insult to treat our veterans in this manner. These are the people who died or were injured so we can have our freedoms. The hospital and staff should be charged with neglect and the health department and the CDC should evaluate.",negative
"The worst hospital ever. Aside from 90% of the nursing staff who were awesome while my husband was in ICU the doctors and surgeons dint seem to communicate. I got different stories from different surgeons. My husband went in for an.outpatient procedure and wound up In ICU intubated and sedated for four days. I argued with the doctors every day to remove the tube. Finally after swearing and yelling they brought a team in to take it out. We had a neurologist student come in just after my husband was given morphine and finally got to rest. He couldn't respond to her demands if him wKimg up so she proceeded to pinch him on his arm that had a pick line going above his heart. that is when i told her to leave. This is how we treat our veterans. No physical therapy. ICU delirium, pneumonia, strep, infection, limited use of his right arm, pain all over his body and now in medication for irregular heartbeat. This is what they gave him. I wouldnt recommend this hospital to anyone.",negative
"Waited 5 hours to be seen, then told the doctor I was in a lot of pain and he said. ""Aren't you a veteran?"" This place is terrible and I'd rather just buy insurance and not deal with them",negative
"Horrible! Called 4 different times to make an initial appointment and each time I was hung up on.

Eventually I came to their emergency room. So far I've been waiting for 2 1/2hrs after getting labs and x-rays done. An hour ago I asked how much longer and was told I was the next patient and they were waiting for a bed. Since then 4 other patients have been called and I'm still waiting.",negative
Requested a different Dr. as mine was very rude and didn't care in the least what I had to say. Was told I would be assigned to a different Dr. and never was. On a separate trip waited hours in the ER with hardly anyone there. It has been MY experience that this place does NOT care about the  Vets. I quit going completely it was so bad!!,negative
"I had-and still have-a painful shoulder.  I went to the Orthpaedic Clinic for evaluation and they wanted to schedule me for a shoulder replacement.  I researched the internet and found that one of the physicians at the Veterans Hospital specialized in shoulder replacements.  I asked her if she was going to do the surgery and she said, ""yes.""  My reply was scheduled me and the date was set.  I went in for the surgery and woke up in the middle of a room with tattered curtains separating me from other patients (one was refusing to eat the food at the VA and the aide didn't want to take him to the bathroom but that's not my situation).  after surgery I had pain in my shoulder and went back and the Doctor said it's ""normal.""  I continued to have pain and went to physical therapy and the pain persisted.  Finally during my annual visit with my Primary Care doctor, she had me see a specialist who said the surgery failed and he wanted to do another reverse shoulder surgery but I refused since ether had once chance and failed, why should I take another chance?  In researching my medal notes, admissions etc, I found that my ""specialist"" who said she would do the surgery was the Attending-not the actual surgeon and I am not only disappointed, I am suffering from a painful shoulder,  I'll go to the VA Hospital for medication but not for surgery again, they had their chance and as far as ai'm concerned the surgery was a dismal failure.",negative
"Terrible service, doesn't seem to be busy but waited over a hour for an appointment. Two people walked out of the office, no one went in and was told they were waiting for a ""room"".  What's the point of making an appointment if it's not going to be respected.",negative
"I would give zero stars if I could. 

Watched a woman beg for help in tears to a male staff member. The male vet she was with was clearly in distress and in need of assistance. It was a terrifying experience for my children, and made the entire room tense and on edge. At one point this man was agitated and not responding to people around him and began pushing the woman he was with. They did absolutely nothing to make the situation better, in fact, they didn't even look fazed by the incident. 

Apparently the nurses in the back found a suicidal vet hilarious, as they were making fun of this man and woman in front of my husband. They also spent time shit talking a heroin-addicted vet, instead of making sure people were receiving treatment. This was all done in front of other veterans waiting on care. After 2.5 hours my husband finally got an x-ray, come to find out the x-ray tech had been waiting on him for quite some time. He left without treatment because he was so upset about the behavior of the staff. He refuses to seek treatment from this facility.

Another vet was completely ignored when he asked a question to staff. They just stared at their computer and didn't bother to look up. He left without getting answers. 

Seriously one of the most disturbing, apathetic group of ""professionals"" Ive ever witnessed. They should all be fired, they have zero concern for the veterans they care for.",negative
I moved here from Seattle and the transition has been terrible. When you called for an appointment no one answers the phone the first time and they don't return the call for one to three days. I tried to make an appointment with neurology and was given an appointment 4 months from now. This is broken system here in Denver.,negative
"This is probably the 13th VA healthcare center I've frequented. I've been to about a dozen across the country and this is BY FAR the WORST! Unfortunate for veterans who have no other healthcare. I had my problems ignored, one record filled with fabrications (things I did NOT state), and have had a few providers be outrageously rude to me. They can't keep good staff because the system is broken, frustrating and outdated. Did you know they use MUMPS for their computer system? This predates MS-DOS. Dismal. Prez Trump, help!

PS, As I was waiting in the emergency department, an older veteran came in having a heart attack. He had to wait his turn in the waiting room! It was a good 15+ minutes before he received attention. Unacceptable.",negative
First time dealing with them and they are definitely living up to their reputation. Made an appointment for lab work and receptionist with an attitude said it wasn't made. I'm not leaving quietly.,negative
"I just returned... boy is my blood boiling. You know, aside from being treated like cattle from every other person in this place besides my primary care doctor, I swear the people here age discriminate. I hate having to go down to this place, it takes no less than 2 hours of my time and that's on a good day. 

Today I had the pleasure of having a parking space that I waited 10 minutes for in the garage stolen by some old couple who completely ignored that I was there long before they were, holding up parking garage traffic waiting for the spot. When confronted about it they ignored the fact that they did anything unsavory and I had to deal with some other old man waggling his finger at me for piping up. What am I, 5?

On top of that, I went the cashier to find out if I owed any money at the pharmacy and literally was completely ignored for 5 minutes. I stood there at the window without so much as a 'hello' or a head nod from the person in the box. Nearly every person I have ever had to deal with in this place seems highly incompetent, save my doctor and her staff at the firm. 

I also went down to records release today, and sat there for 10 minutes waiting for two people who had come in before me to be seen. When the administrator finally finished with the last person in front of me, he came out and walked right by me without even acknowledging my presence and helped the woman who came in 5 minutes after I did. When I finally got taken in to be helped the guy that was helping me just got up and left after slapping a form on the desk for me to fill out. Next thing I know I was being helped by another woman who came in after him.

If this is any indication of what the 'improved' healthcare system that Obama's administration forced through this country is in for a rude awakening. Unless I'm visiting the ER I must make an appointment, and my primary doctor here has a 2 MONTH wait to be seen. Isn't that ridiculous?! It's a good thing my ailments aren't life threatening or anything...",negative
"Had my first apt. Today and I showed up at 745. My apt was at 8. I waited an hour and went to the desk to ask what the hold up was. The front desk person "" It's going to be another 20 mins."" I asked why? The answer was because the doctors are in a meeting. Why would you schedule me when you know the Dr. Is in a meeting. I waited another 30 mins when they finally came out and grabbed me. This was just for a med refill. My first apt is another 3 months out. All the VA's are horrible and no customer service.",negative
This has been horrible. My poor boyfriend has been here for over an hour in severe pain with a kidney stone. He had to pass it with no pain relief. We are still waiting now and he hasn't seen a doctor. They don't have hardly anyone in here and there are 5 nurses just sitting around eating candy. They don't even check in on you!  This is the poorest excuse for a hospital ever!  If we had known we would have paid for a REAL ER. The whole point of coming here was to get immediate pain relief. It's so disappointing. I guess this is what the government pays for..... It's sad.  Apparently they have twelve beds and two doctors. I had to go ask the nurses to at least try and got nothing but sarcasm.,negative
Long waits. Horrible communication between staff and veterans. Understaffed. Lack of care.,negative
"My sister and I brought our dad here this morning for eye surgery and it's unbelievable how unprofessional and rude the hospital staff is! I have to say the ONE nurse that tended to him was very nice, professional and respectful! 
The person that came to wheel our dad away to the OR walked over to where we were waiting and didn't say I'm here to take you or anything along those lines. He stood in front of me and said, ""excuse me!""  
I kind of looked around because I didn't know where he was going, I wasn't blocking a door or anything and the only thing I was by was a wall. He says again, ""excuse me!"" So I asked, ""where are you trying to go?"" He still never said a word, but pointed in my dads direction so I got up and he began to roll my dad away still saying absolutely nothing!!!! 
We were never told where to go to wait, no one asked for either of our numbers to be notified if there were any complications or when he comes out of surgery so we just left got a bite to eat and called to check on him. 
When we returned we asked if he was out, he wasn't so we found a waiting room and asked if someone would please let us know when he comes out. 
The doctors did find us and told us how surgery went and they were nice. But when it was time to leave I requested a wheelchair for him and the lady that came to wheel him out took off with him and left me (I walk with a cane and not very fast) went to an elevator I wasn't familiar with and by the time I made the corner she was inside the elevator and doors were closing 
Like she never saw me and didn't know I was with him. My sister had gone to the pharmacy to pick up his mess and that's where we were going to meet her, but I had never been there and didn't know where I was going. My dad told her to wait and she put her arm in the doors to stop it from closing so I was able to go with him, but it was rude for her to take off and leave me!",negative
90 Miles away from Denver VA and STILL have to wait FOUR MONTHS for a doctors appointment for a 5 minute procedure.  This is costing me a fortune in loss of work!  I have called there 8 times to talk to someone and been over a month and NO ONE has bothered to even call me back.  NOTHING HAS CHANGED!  Very poor service for me as a Veteran that needs medical attention and can't afford to go to a regular doctor down here as would cost me about $3000 out of pocket for the injections!,negative
The staff is unbelievably rude. Especially the social workers.....when they are there and answer their phones which is hardly ever.,negative
"This place as they say in The Army is ""Tore up from the floor up.""

I wouldn't trust this place.  I could rant but I won't. 
Suffice it to say, this place is incompetent. I've experienced it more than once. 

Veterans, seriously.  I wouldn't take a dog here for treatment.  I sure wouldn't recommend it for empathy or human kindness. ",negative
"They were horrible. Anyone looking for medical attention and quality service is better off looking elsewhere. Please don't come here if you can help it , I promise you will be taken care of somewhere else. Not here, not worth it. Only 5 people waitin on the lobby and you still wait 2+ hours.",negative
"The customer service is horrible any time you call the main number (404) 321-6111.   They are not cordial and have an ""I don't want to work"" attitude, they do not let you finish talking before they transfer your call (and some times to the wrong dept.).   I've been on hold past 15 mins. numerous times.   Oh, and.... when you get a recording to leave your phone number so someone can call you back - guess what?  You don't get a call back!   The operators, receptionists or whatever their title is need to be replaced!  I recently moved here and was told this place is horrible.   I'm beginning to believe it.

"A (Decatur) should be ashamed. This place is awful; unorganized, no empathy, rude, unapologetic and disrespectful employees/staff. Today, March 12th my husband (Marine veteran) was told he had an appointment for his COVID Vaccine at 9:45 am. Two days prior he received notification that the appointment was changed to 8:00am. Upon our arrival at 7:30 am there were approximately 200-300 people in line. There was no staff present, no one setting up for shots, no social distancing, no directional signs...just awful. He advised me via cell that the included those for 1st and 2nd vaccines. After standing in line for 3 1/2 hours my husband was finally vaccinated. After moving here to Georgia recently and hearing the horror stories about THIS FACILITY, along with the previous experiences my husband has had hear, I see why this location is ranked last in the country. VA YOU HAVE TO DO BETTER FOR OUR VETERANS--YOU HAVE TO DO BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE!!",negative
"Crap! Straight Garbage!! I can see why they are ranked last in the nation!!! No matter what is wrong with you? Up to and including being gut shot with 12 gauge shotgun??? The doctors will tell you ""nothing is wrong with you."" And discharge you!!!! Worst hospital in the whole United States of America!!!!!!!!!!",negative
"Horrible. From being patronized about issues when speaking with a doctor to absolutely zero patient confidentiality. ER workers slowly drag their feet and the atmosphere is full of ""I don't want to be here"" coming from the staff. (I know how to sense that sort of toxic environment, I served 5 years) 
I left without being treated because this place made my symptoms multiple and sought out care elsewhere.",negative
"This place failed my dad and cost him his life . A terrible loss to my family that could have been avoided. His concerns were over looked and appointments were constantly delayed. Many staff members spoke to him as if his life was meaningless. Yet he put his life on the line and fought for our country . When he needed help it wasn't there for him. He complained of specific problems which were never checked at all. 
Before things went for the worse for my dad . There was a debate weather he'd ever served our country. Really? He impressed me with the documents he was able to keep in a safe place . This included pictures.
On the day of his funeral, his glasses that he'd been waiting in for nearly 6 months arrived at the house via fedex. If you want great care for your loved one, take my strong advice and look elsewhere. After you have served your country you'll be subjected to this neglect. No one should have to endure this. The only thing is guaranteed is a proper burial.",negative
"DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!
I don't understand how they are still open . I've been here for 4 hours so far just for lab work and I still have more time to wait for other stuff to be done . They are inconsiderate and sit around and chat instead of doing their job. The same receptionist has been on break for 3 hours . They've even changed shifts while I was here . I advise for you to just go somewhere else.",negative
HORRIBLE!! ER visit waited 4.5 hours to be seen which is pretty ridiculous and that was just to get lab work done! still needed to get ct scan/ had initially called triage nurse who insisted that i go in immediately for abdominal severe pain. i would rather go to any hospital but here! let me die because clearly they don't care aren't compassionate and unprofessional. throw away the whole VA !,negative
My fiancé has been in the ER for 10 hours now and still hasn't seen the doctor.  This is ridiculous,negative
"I can't even begin to express what a pathetic system the government has in place at this location for the men & women who put their lives on danger & on the line for us to have our freedom.  My husband recently had surgery there.  I've been a nurse 28 years & in all of my years in Healthcare, I have NEVER seen a more disorganized, ""cluster"", Mickey Mouse run facility in my life.  From the change of surgeons at the last minute, to unsanitary conditions, to lack of explanation & understanding of the surgery, to the inattentiveness of dressing a surgical incision, to being told let the ""caregiver"" provide after care.  I was speechless then pissed that my loved one was treated like a statistic not a human being, much less patient.  I have written the VA Administration & while I doubt I will receive any acknowledgement, I felt others should be aware of what they are in for.",negative
The worst customer service.   If you have an 8:30 appt. you would expect to be seen before 2pm. When you check back in after waiting for hours you don't expect to be treated with a horrible attitude. I truly feel sorry for anyone who has to deal with this establishment.  It really deserves a zero star.,negative
The emergency room department sucks...... the people are rude and very slow.....prepare to be stuck just sitting there for 6 hrs or more,negative
The only regular service I use at the VA now is dental care.  I am not at all impressed with it.  Hard to get an appointment.  Treatment should be assigned out to local dentists.,negative
"I have used other VA Medical Centers, and have found the Atlanta VA is the worst you can find in the country. They could care less about taking care of the patints there. When you need something it is a constant fight to get services done there. The emergency room is a total joke and you could be there to you die. Seems that we Veterans were told that the new Director of the medial center would make better changes, but in reality the changes have been for the worse. In fact they have gotten super bad, no one cares there about what we need or ask for from it. They are going to do just what they want and don't care about the Veterans they are serving there. If you can run from them, I can't as I do not have insurance another hospital will take. So I am stuck with the piss poor service that they give to us there.",negative
"If I could rate the medical doctors, the ER, and most importantly, the Vets who work there, I would give them 5 stars.  Outside of that, you're screwed.  Everything else VA sucks!!!!  If you're lucky enough to make it to see a doctor, I think you will be more than pleased with the care.  But of course, trying to get to a doctor is the challenge.  I have nothing but praises for VA and Emory doctors.  The Vets who work there have been nothing short of helpful and empathetic towards my challenges with the VA.  Luckily for them they've had the some of the best training which allows them to excel at what they do, and skillfully manage to survive the day-to-day chaos of a broken and dysfunctional system with a smile, while maintaining their professionalism. I think one of the main problems with the VA is they employ way too many civilians who've had inferior training and are not equipped to deal with the challenges of those of us who have served.  It appears civilians are not vested in their jobs, other than barely doing a half ass job in order to receive a good paycheck. I say this based on poor attitudes and poor customer service I've received.

The parking situation is a joke.  The expectation is for VA patients to take the shuttle to the hospital, while VA employees park on campus.  This is total BS.  Why don't the employees except doctors, take the shuttle and leave the parking lots on campus FOR US VETS!!!!  The VA is suppose to be for Vets, but it appears it's for civilians who work there, and Vets just keep them employed.  What a total travesty.....

Ok, Veterans Choice is an absolute joke.  Talk about waiting to receive care at the VA Hospital, try waiting as long, if not longer for VC.  What I do like about it is that you do have options in terms of care, which seems to be good, so far.  I don't think it solves any of the VA's problems in terms of patients waiting for care.  It seems it was put in place as a pacifier and to help rid itself of the negative media coverage it has received about people dying or excessive waiting for appointments.  But it does a good job of providing an excellent alternative to some of the clinics in the VA like PT, OT, endoscopy, audiology, etc., which I do like a lot.  If they permanently outsourced those services, I wouldn't mind. I can't say anything good about mental health clinicians at the VA; not because the clinicians are not good but they are not properly trained to deal with issues experienced by Vets.  Actually, I think active duty mental health clinicians are probably the best resource for providing mental health services to veterans.",negative
"This place is ridiculous!  I had many issues during my hospital stay for a surgery.  The doctors were great, but I found other staff incompetent.  My Boyfriend was entered into the system over 4 months ago and told that within a week he would receive a letter telling him when his first appointment would be.  FOUR MONTHS LATER...we still have not heard anything, and when we call; after being on hold for over 40 minutes, we get transferred somewhere else (on hold again for 20 minutes), and the issue still is not resolved.  What a terrible way to treat those of us who were willing to put our lives on the line, to protect this country!!!!!",negative
The Atlanta Medical VA is extremely incompetent and lacks compassion for disabled vets. Going to this facility is degrading. I hope the next company I work for has a better medical insurance plan so I won't have to deal with this poorly run facility.,negative
"If I could give this VA NO STARS I WOULD! Don't believe any of the propaganda you read about them improving care for Vets - The ATL VA Atlanta VA Medical Center is the worst run and least compassionate group of people I have ever dealt with in my life. The don't answer phones, their voice mails are always full, When you do get someone on the phone, they have no answers, blame the system, or send you back into the phone system to be lost yet again.  I have wasted nearly 3 hours of lunch breaks over the last 2 weeks trying to resolve appointment conflicts and prescription issues, and NOT ONE PERSON IS WILLING TO HELP ME RESOLVE THE ISSUE! I have even called the Director, Leslie Wiggins at ext. 7602 but I was told she will NOT speak with me... I even had one lady hang up on me after she said that is all she can do, and when I called back I heard several of the office workers making fun of my complaint as if I was a joke....  DISGUSTING HOW THEY TREAT VETS!!!",negative
"I initially went here to get my wife seen about her severe depression. We are both military veterans and suicide and depression is a MAJOR issue in the military community. While we get inside the mental health clinic there were two staff members gossiping about a recent suicide that happened within the system. First of all, suicide is a VERY private matter and to be discussing it inside a mental health clinic so freely is appalling. I was disgusted by their lack of sensitivity to the matter. Finally after the gossip queens were done we were given paperwork to fill out. After completing the paperwork we were sent on a wild goose chase to ""track down"" a social worker to help us. The staff in the mental health clinic gave us ZERO direction and could careless that it was our first time in the hospital. They first directed us to a set of elevators and told us to go to the 5th floor. Mind you, there are only certain elevators in the hospital that take you to the 5th floor. This, we did not know until we spent over 30mins wandering down the halls in search of this social worker we were suppose to meet. After we finally find our way back to the mental health clinic they appeared annoyed that we came back asking for assistance to the 5th floor. This time they sent a staff member to go with us to  find the social worker. Once we finally get on the 5th floor the staff member is wandering down the hall looking for this guys office. She had no idea where he was or if he was even working that day or not. When we finally meet him my wife isn't given any refills on her medicine or given any kind of assistance at all. We were told that a doctor will call and set up an appointment, that was four days ago! We spent over 2 hours in the VA and that time was spent wandering down the halls looking for this social worker guy and waiting. A complete waste of our time. They do not care about your well-being here. You're literally treated like a statistic and that you're a bother. If you do go this hospital be sure to give yourself plenty of time, the parking is an absolute joke!",negative
The emergency room department by far is the worse that I've ever seen connected to a va medical center..... the intake staff is extremely rude and nonchalant and will brush you off quickly without answering your questions or concerns..... it doesn't matter what time a day you come in be prepared to be here for 6 or more hrs...... this is ridiculous and something needs to change and each time they use shift change as an excuse not to do there job...... The VA is doing all these construction changes they need to do a staff change to people that actually care about the providing good patient care as well it shouldn't be this difficult or hard.,negative
"DOES NOT DESERVE 1 STAR!!!!!

This Hospital should close their doors and should be ashamed of themselves for how they treat the Veterans who served this country.
As for the 11th floor (I believe 11 west), most Nurses and Aides are incompetent and should be on the unemployment line. Their arrogance and attitudes are unacceptable and have been told so. I am not comfortable with my Father ever being admitted into this Hospital again, so I am hoping he will never allow himself to be admitted there again. I do not trust them, I do not appreciate their attitudes towards their patients and I do not trust them with his care. 
My Father was there for a week and it was a nightmare for him as well as myself for the entire duration of his stay. An Aide gave my Father a difficult time and yelled at him for requesting a pair of socks (THE AUDACITY!) Especially, given the fact that it had taken well-over an hour after he rang for assistance. You could die, waiting for someone to answer after you ring for assistance, and this is unacceptable. Then some low-life steals my Father's phone charger, and if all of this is not bad enough... The person my Father was in his room with, had Covid. 
So, this poor excuse for a Hospital, not only put my Father at risk, but put myself and my family members. To add insult to injury... I complained to the Nurse's Station that the person in my Father's room had been coughing, wearing no mask and felt my Father could be at risk, but it fell on deaf ears. You walk up to the Nurses Station and they are all chit-chatting, not acknowledging me, until I get annoyed and express so. Then, they ignore you or put their heads down as I'm explaining this person is constantly coughing and it needs to be addressed. Again, no one does a darn thing about it, until 5 days later when they test the person and find that he has Covid. I went to Patient Relations, only to be handed a form and told filling out the form would probably be just a waste of time. Can you believe this? I can't!!!! This is what they have working in this Hospital.
If you can't believe it could get any worse, it does.... My Father's room was disgusting and FILTHY!!! I made several complaints about blood being on the floor in my Father's room which wasn't his, but the person who had Covid, the bathroom was filthy and garbage was left on the floor many times. After numerous complaints, they started to clean more consistently but you had to complain numerous times before it was done. This is also unacceptable! 
My heart goes out to the Veterans that are admitted into this Hospital. I noticed that many do not have visitors and have no one to speak up for them, and this gives the Aides and some Nurses free-will to mistreat or neglect their patients. The person my Father shared a room with had his hand tied, therefore could not eat by himself, so you would think the staff would have been on top of this and knew to feed him or untie his hands when meals were given out, but nooooo..... Hours later a Nurse would comes in, ask why he didn't eat and the poor Veteran would state ""How am I suppose to eat, my hands are tied"". How shameful and DISGUSTING!!! The Hospital staff eat and enjoy their meal breaks, but let a patient go unfed. I remain appalled, disgusted and angry and although I asked the Nursing Supervisor for the name of the Aide who yelled at my Father as well as the Nurses who were on staff that evening, she never gave me those names. I guess those who names were withheld are lucky, because they certainly would have endured the wrath of my fury!
To the Administrator who was MIA... is this how you run a Hospital? Its shameful, it's despicable, and I will report this to whomever will listen. I AM NOT DONE!!!  
To those who have loved one's in this Hospital... please be at the forefront of his or her care, because if you choose not to do so, you are putting your loved one at risk.
I would stay clear of this AWFUL PLACE, because this is not the first horrendous experience my Father had here, but the second. They will not get a third chance, if I can help it.",negative
I would never recommend this hospital as it is completely unsanitary. I have had multiple infections following surgery in this hospital. The bed I was moved to following my surgery clearly still had feces from another patient and another patients blood on the floor. The surgical procedure body location changed on the day of my surgery simply to train a Radiologist in residence. Most staff are kind but GYN never follows up. It is sinful that on at 3 occassions the unclean conditions have put me in a detrimental situation.,negative

Ridiculous, if I was sick and needed to see a doctor my immune system would have already fought off the virus/bacteria. That or I would be in the ER because I would have gotten even sicker. Horrible. And then every time I schedule a GYN appt, the doctor strolls in late. Like how do you walk in at 1100 for my 0900 appointment? Like I have all day to wait for you. I scheduled that appointment early because I have things to do!",negative
They are terrible. With all the problems with veterans today everyone from nurses to doctors patronize and just pass the buck as much as they can disgraceful service to our nations heroes,negative
"I normally would not leave a review because I do not like to bash any establishment! But this shit have gone way too far now. Please explain to me how the fuck I came in the emergency room at 10pm where there's no patient in sight but myself. Got checked in and taking to the back where they ask me what my reason coming and got put in a bed. An hour and half later here comes the doctor !!! Like are you really serious right now almost two hours later, what if I had internal bleeding or better yet I had some shit that needed immediate attention, I could of fucking died. Never again for an emergency room where you think you would get fast treatment this place is the worst, I rather go to a regular doc and pay the co payment than come back here again!",negative
"Last June I had an appt. to see the urologist at the Brooklyn, VA for a second opinion. When I arrived I told the med tech I was there for a second opinion for kidney stones. He quickly told me the VA does not offer second opinions. At that point, I left and never saw the doctor. However, 6 months later I received a bill for 65.00 dollars (co-pay). I was outraged. Why would the VA bill me for doing absolutely nothing? So, I went to the Admin Office to complain about it but they couldn't do anything and had no answers.
This type of treatment for veterans is disgraceful and shameful. I also discovered they have been billing 3 of my medical insurances including a co-pay of $50.00 every time I have an appointment. I feel this borders on a criminal enterprise and ought to be investigated by the Inspector General. I did put in a complaint with them and now we'll see if they entertain it. I will give you a follow-up on this matter in the near future.",negative

"Rude staff, especially in the pulmonary department.  If you are in need of specialty care, be prepared to wait for a call.  If you are lucky enough to receive a call then don't expect any kind of customer service.  Most people who work at this facility do not care about patients let alone veterans.

Literally every single time you call the appointment line, every singe time, the minimum wait will be 45 minutes. That is the minimum.

Rude staff.

I waited for 2 hours in the lobby before breaking down and asking why I wasn't seen only to discover they never printed my charts and sent my paperwork back to the doctor.

I went to the women's clinic and I cannot get a simple referral to mental health.  The quality of patient care here is sub standard and  a change in management and patient care is absolutely necessary!

Bad I don't want to live in Wilmington because of the VA clinic!,negative
Absolutely horrible. I haven't been going here a year yet and already there are communication problems that led me missing weeks of medication that I need. When I try to call the phone just rings and rings. Someone called me to verify the dosage which I had already done and was extremely rude. Now I've gone two weeks without meds and I am so dizzy I can't hardly stand. Hopefully Trump will take care of this mess of a clinic they have going on.,negative
"What can I say... Probably the worst medical care I have ever received. As a Purple Heart Vet OIF 1, I am sad this is the kind of care vets receive.

I was asked later why I didn't use the overflow parking across the river. WHAT PARKING ACROSS THE RIVER??? I never heard of this. The guard in the parking lot never told us during the ten to twenty passes we made through the full lot. There are no signs that I saw, but maybe i couldn't see the signs through my anger.

Very unpleasant experiences with this facility. It's a wonder how some of these providers have been given the honor to work with some of the finest soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, and coastguardsmen.

"The VA is terrible and this location is one of many that doesn't care how veterans are treated. Tried to reach a nurse to schedule my surgery and it took 3 weeks for me to finally get the surgery scheduled. I would call and leave a secure message and wouldn't get a call back until 7 or 8 days later. Each time I spoke with Tracie Citron in the Neurology department, she had a different lie about why she was unable to contact me in a timely manner. I called the patient advocate and they did the bare minimum, so they weren't much help. I contacted the directors office and left 4 messages for someone to call me back. I wanted to give the director feedback how this employee was not doing her job in a timely manner. I wanted to convey to the director the problems I was having so the veterans after me might not have to face what I went through to schedule my surgery. I was given the contact info of one person and one person only that you can contact to schedule your surgery. I would call and secure message and receive a call back 7-8 days later each time. If she is doing it to me, then I bet other veterans are facing the same issue. Back to the director, I tried to contact 4 times via voicemails and no return calls. I called back a 5th time and spoke with a young lady that took down my info and promised me someone would call me back. Well, it's a week later and NO ONE has called me back. I called again today (6th attempt) and spoke to a very rude man and was told I didn't follow the proper channels so I couldn't speak with the director. I explained over and over to the man that I did contact the patient advocate and nothing was changed so that's why I wanted to speak with the director. Apparently, they aren't interested in hearing about how their veterans are treated. Filling a VA inspector general complaint. This type of treatment goes against the VA's promise and mission statement of how they intend to treat veterans.

I just want their employees to do their jobs!!!

You won't get a response to any of the negative reviews on Yelp because they just don't care about the veterans.",negative
"Just spent 1 1/2 hours waiting for appointment and the doctor never showed up, this is for a dermatology appointment made 6 months ago. Finally we left. There explanation.

Cons: Totally unprofessional nurses. My dad felt like he was in the 7th circle of hell during his stay in the hospital. They loudly gossip right outside the rooms in the hallway and every single nurse that came in basically told us the same unnecessary/irrelevant information. They treated him like a child and desperately need more training on PROFESSIONAL patient interaction/communication. He was misdiagnosed then pretty much kicked to the curb. Enough said.,negative
"I never review hospitals because a there's probably no point but hell I've been sitting here for 3 hours so why not!

We came here because my father fell and needed to be seen. We have been sitting in an over-conditioned room for three hours and have seen no doctor. There was only one person ahead of us! Veterans deserve better care than this. The man ahead of us was sitting for 4 hours. We both agreed we should've just went to Kaiser of all places and would've been seen already. I suggest if you have other options go there or spend your whole day in a room hoping to see a doctor.",negative
Absolute worst healthcare facility I've been too. The doctor seeing me ignored me during my diagnosis as well as shouted out my lab results to the rest of the staff (HIPPA). The psych unit's front desk staff openly complained about having to see patients that they did not deem important. Waiting in the lobby for the Psychiatry emergency walk in took over  2 hours while the staff pushed newer walk in patients in front of me. Their are several times patients were pushed in front of me all within this one visit. The staff here is highly unprofessional.,negative
"Wow what an awful place.  So when I see my doctor she is asking questions and typing my answers in.  You can't see her face because it is blocked by two computer screens.  She asks me to slow down because she can't type that fast.   She shows no concern for me and actually never makes eye to eye contact.  She is constantly berating the antiquated va system.  I felt like a number and nothing more.  Then she asks me what I want her to do.  Really .... you are The doctor thought that was what you were supposed to tell me.  So we serve and this is how we are treated!  What a sad way of saying thank you.  But thanks to Obama care I can't afford anything else!  Screw you saying 'thank you for your service' , sick of hearing that.  Just keep your promise to me as I kept my promise to my country while I served!!!",negative
"I wish I could give negative stars. This place is trash. I know VA places sucks ass but this one especially sucks ass. We've been here over 3 fucking hours and all we've gotten was a fucking gown. Waiting on this damn doctor to come by. Cant someone here act like a fucking professional. I swear all the employees here act like they have something better to do than help their patients. So many veterans commit suicide a day, those numbers could probably go down if fucking VA employees actually did something other than pick their asses. I swear to god. A veteran came in with suicidal thoughts and they left him in the waiting room for hours before someone saw him... these people risked their fucking lives for this country the least they could get is some damn decent care. Fuck this place.",negative
"Parking is horrible!  It was horrible before the renovations started and now it's worse! There is no real assistance from anyone helping to load or unload, give direction, offer a wheel chair or anything that would make it easier to get help for a sick or injured person. 

The waiting room is a disorganized joke. The only reason I give it one star is because the waiting room was fairly clean. The triage staff is very dismissive. I'm sure it's because they are slammed with question concerning the long wait. The wait time is measured in hours. I was there with my father for more than 7 hours and that was just to get a room in the ER, the doctor still had not seen him in all that time. The nurses and other staff in the back were loud and complaining about their work...who wants to hear that when you're sick or injured. Still waiting while writing this review...a change in administration has done nothing....the Veterans  Administration  needs to do better!",negative
