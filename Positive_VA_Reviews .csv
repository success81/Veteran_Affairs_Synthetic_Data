"Covid-19. concerns kept me out of the VA hospital for a year.
VAbtakes care of my hearing (and hearing loss).
many times I have visited the hearing clinic. however, over the past year my hearing loss was worsening.
I set an appointment, and was seen by ""Maralee"".
OMG, she spent a great deal of time tweaking and tuning, checking and rechecking my hearing aids.
Net result?
huge increase in what I can hear and speech I can interpret.
I have had good serves in the hearing clinic before but, her knowledge, professional, and understanding, merit highlighting with a 5-star review.
Thank you Maralee.",positive
"As soon as I heard veterans were eligible to get the Covid vaccine, I called the minute they opened to schedule for my fianc√©. Even so, I was the 44th caller in line.

It went pretty quick, and the person who answered the call was so friendly and so patient. He scheduled the second appointment as well. 

Thank you!",positive
"I am a proud Veteran and happy that's there's a good support & benefits system in place for our past and current Veterans who need help or might need help in the future.  The lines are short, the staff are very friendly & helpful, lots of parking, great access to transportation, plethora of information, clean & inviting facilities and a great place to Connect with other Veterans to share information about Veterans benefits.  The only negative is that the phone service doesn't work in the building and thsts there's no WiFi. Other than that this is truly a great facility.",positive
"I am normally seen at the Atlanta VA but was in Seattle for work and needed refills on my medications. While there was a little mix up with where I needed to go to get my meds, everyone I can in contact with was very pleasant and helpful.",positive
"I for one am impressed with the overall care that has been provided to me.  

As a combat veteran with multiple medical problems, I have been treated with respect, kindness and care in a timely fashion.

Yes, I will admit once in a while some staff members will have a bad day, but I try to remember there are more patients having bad days and focusing their anger on the staff.  As patients we need to show some respect to these care givers as they work very hard for us veterans.

Any way, this is a new/updated facility, lots of parking, tons of volunteers to answer questions, help you find where you need to be and they are extremely friendly.

You can access you records, request, see lab and x-ray results, request  appointments, order Rx refills and contact your PMD using the VA internet.

I have never waited long for an appointment to PMD or speciality clinic, it seems they want to see me more than I want to see them.",positive
"Best service that I could have wished for. Crawled into the ER this morning with extreme stomach pain. Found out I needed my appendix out. They were very organized and friendly. I'm already home and feel great!!! I'm at the VA often and have never once had an issue there. I love the care I get here!!!

"I have been in-patient and used the outpatient Seattle VA hospital services. I have, in general and overall, had great experiences in both settings.
As a female vet, I am leary of primarily male dominated enviromments, however, I feel the Puget Sound VA has gone above and beyond to ensure that it is a safe and dignified environment for all. 
It has been refreshing, especially in the in-patient setting, to enjoy the military comraderie without a lot of the negative aspects or treatment of being the non-majority gender. 
Thank you SEATTLE VA for being heads above other VA systems.",positive
"Love-love the VA!

I also love-love the friendly, helpful, and courteous staff throughout the hospital and especially at my Primary Care Clinic - and of course the Pain Clinic! 

Thank you for all of your continuing support and wonderful care!",positive
"I have spent time in three local hospitals over the last 10 years - each visit over 5 days and I would vote the the VA hospital is the best.      Not only are they extremely friendly and do everything they can - they are great at their jobs.       This hospital is also a teaching hospital for the University of Washington and so you can get the added help from teaching doctors and their students.     The only complaint for an extended stay would be the food is not as good as others.   

I also use this place for my regular checkups, eye examinations, hearing aids and hearing checks along with prosthetic's and other monitoring.    In the many many visits to this place - everyone greets you - helps you - shows concern and make the experience as pleasant as possible.  

The Emergency Room treatment is professional and also friendly and professional.",positive
I have received numerous treatments there and they were great.  Sometimes it's the patient's attitude that will influence providers to provide great care.  Cheers!,positive
"I'm a Viet Nam veteran - Danang to the DMZ, 1968-1969. Unlike  some, my health has been pretty good, and since 1) my wife and I have had conventional health insurance for decades and 2) years ago I had read that V.A. hospitals were in the tank, I gave the Seattle V.A. hospital no thought. I talked with a veteran/friend who had severe hearing loss, however, and I told him I was heading in that same direction, driving my wife nuts. He said to check out the V.A. for hearing aids. I did. And that worked out wonderfully. In the process, my wife scheduled an exam with a urologist due to my urinary problems although I had a urologist already. Long story short, the V.A. urologist quickly figured out what was wrong, scheduled me for surgery, and when I went in for surgery (partial prostatectomy) a small army awaited me in the surgery room. They were ready. Very impressive. I came out, recovered in a couple of weeks, and am in better shape now than I was 15 years ago. I should mention one more thing: the people who work at the Seattle V.A. (I've talked with them about this) want to be there, want to help veterans. Five stars.",positive
"My 1st visit to the Seattle VA or any VA.
I was impressed by the everyone that I came in contact with, admin staff, doctors, nurses, physical therapist!
The courtesy that I received was above and beyond. I highly recommend this VA to any vet that needs help.

Update 3rd visit: I don't know about other VA's, I'm here to tell you the VA gets a bad rap!!!! Everyone from the doctors, nurses, staff are kind courteous and timely. Equal to some of the best hospitals I've been too here in Seattle. Sure there are VA's that drop the ball. But isn't about personal responsibility to take control of ones health. I noticed on my third visit that there are advocates help patients through the process.

4th visit - Once again no disappointment!
New parking garage is great.",positive
"There is good and bad. But the good far out weighs the bad. My dads a disabled Vietnam vet who did 2 tours during the heat of the war with the Marines. The hospital is pretty run down but the staff is great! I don't know why so many complain. Let's be real! Everyone knows the VA provides free medical so of course your not going to get the same experience you would get at Swedish or your private dr. If this is not acceptable then you are in luck you can pay for insurance like most of us do that allows you to go where you want and isn't so bogged down. Perhaps the va should start charging like everyone else with reasonable monthly premiums, co pays and deductibles and use that money to hire more and fix it up!",positive
Great place to receive healthcare if you are a veteran.  They built a modern looking parking lot (multi story) that looks beautiful.  There are many health care providers here willing to help out a veteran in any capacity they can.,positive
"VA Seattle Medical center and Mt. Vernon VA clinic are the best in VA health care system.
Parking, security,administration,nurses and Drs are very efficient and honest,patient and family centered care. Scheduling for Drs takes 2weeks only.    My family can't wait to go back to VA Puget Sound health care system ASAP.   Thanks to  VA puget Sound health care system and especially  Dr. Rogenburger and staffs in Mt Vernon VA clinic. 

We have been to Denver VAMC, parking is night mare and administrative staffs are not too efficient and lack of accountability in scheduling and rescheduling for Drs absents.  Scheduling for Drs takes 2months.
I did not know how excellent VA PSHS was until I found out out how bad Denver VAMC was",positive
"after two decades the va has saved me 3 different times. heart attack, diabetes, retinal detached,along with other things (tmi) i can only say each and every contact has been 5 star including the service at the coffee bar just inside the main entrance today 10-16-18 730am!!  i hope the top #1 person that provides this image gets to read this! volunteers are there to help and yes they do!  bless you, thank you, i will always love you!!",positive
"About seven Months ago I had total knee surgery. This was my first experience with the VA, and after inquiring about the the service and what to expect not to mention cost! I went ahead with the procedure. With the exceptions of long wait times at the pharmacy I must say that my total experience was excellant.  The Doctor's were from the University of Washington and I think the nurses were as well.  The quaility of the service was everything that one might expect at any civilan facilitiy.  I was treated with respect, and given around the clock attention while staying at the hospital (stayed 3 days).  My rehab was also a great experience as I was given good instruction and even given an additional week (my choice) for further rehab.  This experience has change my view of the VA, and my fellow Veterans.  A lot of the Vet's were in very bad shape both mentally, and phyically but all that I witness were treated with dignity and respect!",positive
"I have been going to the VA in Seattle since the late 70's and I have the most respect for all the Doctors & Nurses that have worked and taken care of me.  I have been treated with the utmost care each and every time I have been there.  Over the years there has been surgeries on both or my legs, plus both legs have had to have knees replaced, the removal of one Kidney (due to a cancer going off of it),  and recently a total left shoulder reconstruction.  I can't say enough about the care from all doctors and nurses each time.  Yes there are long lines for several departments and Yes due to the volume they handle their are long waits to have a surgery preformed, but it is done right and all follow up care is excellent to.  If one actually looked at the volume the Pharmacy handle you will notice that the waits aren't nearly as long as they use to be.  There's a lot of us Military guys out there that need care and Seattle VA is improving daily by my eyes.  Keep it up!!!",positive
"Thank you all who have taken good care of me for the last 4 years. From the staff in the emergency room. 4-6 visits there. The eye care team. Miles in Prosthetics, my Endocrinologist, and to the great one Dr. Scalapino in Rheumatology. The veterans in the Portland area should be thankful they have such good care. A winning formula with the VA partnering with OHSU!  We are relocating to Atlanta where in Decatur the VA has a similar system where they are partnered with the infamous Emery University. Thank you all from myself and my wife.",positive
"I have visited the Portland VA Medical center with my Father in Law dozens of times. We volunteer to visit Veterans who are hospitalized as members of an organization called the Military Order of the Cootie, chartered by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The staff here, especially the nurses, are amazing. Today, I took him to get his first of two COVID Vaccinations. They had everything well organized, safe and efficient. Everyone was kind and professional. Outstanding job to all the front line workers, you are saving countless lives and we are grateful.",positive
"I got a free pair of stylish ,wired framed glasses.I was seen originally at River City Eye near where I live in Milwaukie.A four star private practice business to take my eye exam and glucoma test. Then I went to  the V A optometrist with 
my prescription to get me fitted for a good pair of stylish (light) frames and chose of lined or progressive lenses.Only criticism I have is that this took over two months from Phone to VA admissions and finally glasses delivered.             I always enjoy getting treated with respect by caregivers at hospital but they are skittish about having you in the building at all since the covid epidemic.I can not wait to go thru hoops in future though if the results are so worth it.",positive
"Kind, loving, respectful care

Every time I take my 91 year old dad to the VA, I am so impressed with the high caliber of care that he receives. Unfailingly, from the health screening at the door to the doctors, nurses and attendants, are patient and professional. 
First rate care.",positive
"I just returned from the ER at the Portland, Or. It was very slow but I was treated well and got everything done that needed to be done. All VA medical hospital are under finance and under staff, but they are doing very well at Portland VA Medical Center. Thank you",positive
The Portland VA Medical Center Audiology Department provides outstanding care. Their Audiologists are caring attentive and most all great at helping with any problems with service connected hearing loss.,positive
"Hands down, THE NICEST VA HOSPITAL I'VE EVER BEEN TO!
You can get up here via car or bus, but the best part is if you take the Sky tram up here from OHSU Health Center. The OHSU is connected to the VA Center too. The cost is $5 one way going up or down, but well worth the breath taking views. 

During the day, there are medical personnel running around assisting veterans get their prescriptions and needs checked out. 

After hours, they have Bingo Night for veterans! 

Service here was very quick and the people here are super friendly!",positive
"The VA and OHSU have saved my life --  OHSU for radiation in tandem with the Portland VA for chemo, 3x/week hydration and overall ENT care. Every single one of the 50 or so people I have met there over that time, from doctors, nurses and technicians to clerical workers and even wheelchair pushers, has treated me with care, courtesy, consideration and kindness. And competence. I'm now cancer-free and they're working hard to keep me that way. Statistics, by every measuring system there is, show the VA to be the best healthcare system in the country. Every time I meet a doctor or nurse, I always ask, How do you like working at the VA? All of their answers so far -- really, every single one of them -- have been identical: they all say, ""I love it."" Nobody gets on them about the cost of a specialist referral and they never have the built-in conflict of ordering something that can put money in their pocket. The goal is patient care and everything else comes in a very distant second. Most of the complaints about the VA come from its right-wing enemies who want to starve and then kill it so they can get their hands on its big budget for private profit. Delays? The VA has more than 50,000 unfilled and unfunded job slots, so no wonder you may have to wait to see a doctor. I wish they would convert it into VA-for-all care, like the UK's National Health Service. Until they do, when they get rid of this Horror-Clown and his henchpeople next November I hope they will fully fund and staff it. ",positive
Thank you Portland VA for your kindness and quick service! I wish all VA facilities were like the ones here in Oregon,positive
I have been in the VA health care system since 2008. I have been in hundreds of times including emergency.All I can say is they have saved my life twice and I have always been treated with respect.There is a system in place and its up to you to  be responsible and plan ahead.Vietnam combat vet.1968-1969.,positive
"Wow - could getting an operation be any better?  If you have to do it - here is the place.

What an incredible job from the top surgeon on down to the fellow who checked us in.  You are So taken care of.  SO given kind and courteous/thoughtful attention.  They have a lovely sense of humor to lighten it all up and a lovely facility.

I can't imagine a more pleasant experience if you have to go through medical treatment.

They also treated my friend's prostate cancer the same way - and he has been great ever since the surgery and treatments.

Go VA Hospital - with yo bad self! :-",positive
"What a wonderful array of services this flagship facility offers our veterans. From top tier medical services (many associated with the UofU) to yoga and cooking classes to a credit union, this medical center cares for those who have borne battle with compassion and efficiency. The reports of long wait times do not apply to this SLC facility. 

The buildings are not shiny and new, but the staff and services are first class. It is, of course, the government with lots of red tape, but there is lots of assistance available for the asking. Patient education and recreational options abound. 

I am proud that our vets are so well taken care of. 
Never forget!

Great hospital with state of the art technology. Amputee program is outstanding. Surgery area is great with wonderful surgeons.,positive
"The Audiology department has provide great service for my hearing loss, caused in Vietnam!",positive
"I've always had fast courteous service & doctors, technicians, nurses have been over the top in giving the services I need. I can't imagine a health care provider giving better service.",positive
"My father had a life threatening surgery done here. He also had to have 2 more surgeries due to complications. The surgeons, doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses, and everyone we came into contact with in SICU, were absolutley amazing! I firmly believe had it not been for them, my father would not be here today!",positive
These guys took care of my father when he was ill and were very respectful in everything they did. I cannot thank them enough for all of their efforts and compassion.,positive
I can't say enough about how great this place is for veterans. I have been to a number of VA health care facilities and this one is by far the best!,positive
"I've been a member of the VA here in this area for about three years. 

This hospital is very professional, even though it's under staffed and operating effectively during a global pandemic. 

The heart, orthopedic and hearing (was shot in the back early 20's point blank in the back from M16 blank entered my upper back, stationed in Germany) departments are great. 

I recently received my first vaccine shot. A long wait in line (military style patience I have) but staff was plenty and they kept order of the few complainers. Thumbs up. 

Very clean facility. Volunteers are always helpful. Cafeteria is clean but the chow is hit and miss depending on the week. 

Safe parking lot. Easy parking. 

Very clean inside the VA. 

Keep up the good work and always say thank you, have a great day. Most were veterans themselves.",positive
"I had several tests to be done at the VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System at the North Hospital and I could not have been treated any better.  I'd like to show my appreciation to Nursing Assistant Michelle in Pre-Op, Rochelle in Pre-Op, and Maxine in Pre-op for their professionalism, friendliness, and going well beyond what would be considered normal care.  I also want to say thanks to those in the Lab and X-Ray for their much appreciated care and professionalism.  Things have definitely improved in the VA system and it is obviously apparent.  I also had my 2nd Covid shots  recently,  and even with extremely long lines, I was in and out in a reasonable time and I was continuously thanked for my service by those that were part of the team doing the inoculations.  Thanks SNVA Healthcare System, you may not hear it as often as you should but you are much appreciated.",positive
"I have spent hours trying to set up covid testing appointment all over this town and every time I filled out the forms at the end of form it would state we are full find another location.  A complete joke.   
2 other times I had a testing appointment at cvs, i show up to appointments and the lady screams at me I cant test you at this time  make another appointment
Vegas covid testing is completely dysfunctional!
I drove to VA hospital ER.  i received the test and had my results within an hour   Thank you VA for being there.   Again outstanding service for us veterans!!!",positive
I have visited many VA medical facilities and this is far one of the nicest facilities that I have ever scene.  It is not terribly busy like most VA medical centers. It is not as big but it is well staffed.  I didn't see lines hanging  out the doors and frustrated vets.  It seemed like everyone was serviced in a timely matter.  Either one of two things is the reason why this place is not packed...1 they don't know where it is.  Since it's far away from the strip.  2.  Not enough vets in the area.  ,positive
"Not sure why Yelp deleted my last 5 Star Vietnam Veterans review?  They said that it was not a review of mine since my dad is the person getting the help.  Let me clarify please, yes dad see's the doctors, but I have went into ALL of his appointments & met all of the doctors & nurses.  I make ALL of my dad's appointments & bring him to & from each.  I personally have met w/ the foot & ankle doctor, audiologist, urologist, primary care physician, cardiologist so feel that my review does matter & count.  

From a daughter's perspective, ALL of the doctors here have been helpful & professional to my family & I.  All of the receptionist that I have spoken to over the phone, have been also.  

In Iowa, it was not like this so I think after all of the criticism the VA's have had, I am impressed.  All Veterans & their families need to know that this is an exceptional facility & you can feel safe in their hands.  

Easy accessibility & parking off of the freeway, everyone is so helpful & are veteran doctors & nurses.  This is a $3billion facility, beautiful w/ pictures of Vietnam Veterans medals, memorabilia & wonderful tributes to their hard work & service to our country.  

Overall, after being to the VA multiple time, they are wonderful & deserve 5 stars.  Especially as a family member who has concerns & worries about where their loved one is going & being cared for.",positive
"Friendly staff...never knew you can have this much fun at a VA Hospital! I went to pick a friend up from same day surgery...the nurse was so friendly and had a cool and outgoing personality,that would make anyone comfortable about going under the knife. And believe me that's a special skill right there! They definitely have an ideal staff,felt like I already knew everyone when I walked in. All I was missing was a cup of coffee!!!",positive
"I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of service and staff here at this VA facility. Parking is excellent and valet services are offered. 

An absolutely beautiful building with lots of room for expansion and a scenic location!",positive
Between the ER crew and the 1 West crew. Wow!!! Service was awesome.  Great people just doing their jobs with care and enjoying it. No complaints at all. This the best admission i have ever had. Staff is attentive sweet and courteous. Amazing feeling.,positive
Found myself very ill and out of town.  Very kind and compassionate people that work here.  Beautiful facility and very clean.,positive
"I am profoundly disabled and receive my healthcare from eight different clinics there at the VA. Were it not for the incredible treatment, support, and care I receive, I honestly would not be on the shiny side of the mud today.  All of my providers and their supporting staff sincerely give a hoot. They are professional, knowledgeable, and dedicated.

For their continued service to our veterans, I am truly appreciative!",positive
"The best VA that I have ever visited!  No healthcare, private or public is perfect, but they try so hard at this VA and really care about the patients.  Beautiful facility.  The doctors are caring and really good.  I would highly suggest this VA!!!",positive
Super fast and extremely good customer service. We were able to get all of Hubby's file moved from Cali in less then an hour. It's nice to have have VocRehab at the same location as medical app.,positive
"VA has done a 180 on taking care of our Vets.  They still have a way to go, but the improvements are positive and very noticeable.  I ignored  the VA for 15 years because  the few times I tried to  get help,  I was either ignored or the services were extremely difficult to navigate or obtain.  The VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System is really trying too change the attitude in their facilities.  Keep moving forward!  And, Thank You!!!",positive
"Very professional, attentive and no wait time for your appointment. Checking in is a self service kiosk, which is helpful. Beautiful and clean hospital.",positive
"Had surgery on my Meniscus/Acl. Performed by Dr.Lactose (he's a looker, but that's neither here nor there). Once they went in to repair my acl it was noted I had a partially torn acl, and previous injury. Long story short, all I needed was a scope to remove the scar tissue. My bad knee is now my good knee. They were efficient with the scheduling of my pre-op appointments as well as scheduling my surgery. 
Civilians didn't treat me as well (see review for Pro-Care medical) so I ended up going here. Again, I'm grateful. There ARE no big people vs little people in terms of patient care. I sincerely believe they have taken their time to select those who work in this facility. Way to take care of your vets!",positive
"My husband and I are both 20 year veterans, we moved to Las Vegas back in 1997 and have used the VA Medical Facilities almost exclusively.  99% of my care has been EXCELLENT.  Naturally, there have been a few incidents along the way that were annoying, but that's to be expected.  Beautiful new hospital.  Staff that cares about people.  Knowledgeable doctors and nurses.",positive
"Went in to pick up a friend who is a retired Captain in the Army.  Reading everything in press last two years about Veteran Hospitals candidly i didn't know what to expect.  But from the moment I pulled in to the minute we left I experienced nothing but efficient,  friendly and knowledgeable staff and volunteers.   In terms of equipment that I noticed I couldn't think of anywhere having more up to date.  Also, want to note how clean everything was.

Compared to the experiences I've had at regular hospitals this blew them away.",positive
Always treat me great when I go there and super friendly and professional and honored I get to go there !,positive
"This is the best VA hospital we have found in the U.S.  The facility is beautiful and most importantly the service received is first rate, professional and full of care for patients!  Christina Campos/LCSW, TCM Case Manager is fantastic on every level!",positive
The VAMC in las vegas nevada is a really good place to take care of all the health needs for our Veterans in southern Nevada all the staff I have dealt with our very professional and courteous to all veterans at the VA hospital in las vegas nevada,positive
"This VA North Las Vegas has the most friendliest group of people, from the greeters to the security, all the way to Physician seeming me. The process was quick and efficient. Night and Day compare to all the hospital in Las Vegas. Simply awesome! Good job guys!",positive
"Had to take a good friend there after her long flight from China where she had broken her leg. They were the most compassionate people in every way - from security all the way to the doctors.  Excellent is all we could say, thank you to all who work there.",positive
"I am never less than amazed and completely appreciative of the services I receive each and every time I come to the VA Hospital.  Yesterday, I had a Cardio Rehab appointment to further enhance my recovery and care following heart surgery.  I had the pleasure of meeting Melissa Hosford, my kinesiotherapist.  What a wonderful young lady, Melissa.  Very kind and caring, professional to the max, and I was especially attracted to her sense of humor (she laughed at my jokes).  I also met Denny, Melissa coworker.  What a great service made available to us veterans.  This facility is magnificent.  I've had total (right) hip replacement done here.  I've had other procedures completed as well, and I must say....I've had ZERO bad or even uncomfortable experiences at this hospital.  Every employee, doctors, nurses  etc., have all been very professional and very courteous.  I commend them all for their service.  Melissa Hosford is certainly no exception: she is definitely one of the nicest young women I have ever met in my 73+ years of life.  I truly believe the world is a much better place with people like her in it. :)",positive
"First I have used the VA Southern Nevada Healthcare for over 15 yrs now.  This is far superior than any other VA I used in other states.  I primarily have used the Women's Clinic and have had excellent service. I was referred to Dr Gupta (Director) concerning a female problem which required surgery.  I was nervous, but she (Gupta) put me at ease and the day of the surgery I had all females for my surgery.  Everything went as promised and months later I'm feeling wonderful.  I have also had excellent care for the hearing aides I wear and again found the doctors and staff to be caring, patient and very knowledgeable.  My father has just came under my care with the help of Hospice.  I just finished a appointment with the Primary Care Clinic (Dr Lee); again not only was I delighted with the excellent care he received from Dr Lee and her staff, but was amazed I was contacted 6hrs prior to his appointment by  Dr Lee's assistant.  She wanted some background information prior to his appointment......who does that now days????.   Now I understand Dr Lee is new at the VA and some of ""our"" requests weren't the usual requests for her (dad is under civilian Hospice)...but she promised to get back with me and my father....you know, I totally believe she will and this will not be an empty promise!!!!",positive
"My dad went in On tues on an emergency and he doesn't live here. They took us right in, paperwork already in system from his home state. Everyone so nice , helpful , above and beyond, doctor was great and very attentive and thorough. The place is awesome and very clean. I hate hospitals but this one was so great !! Even my dad who is 87 said he could not be receiving better care . In regards to his issues they would not release him until they were certain all was well. Thanks VA. That's how we treat our veterans!!keep up the good work :)",positive
My husband has been in the VA health system for 20 years. He has always received great care . He has had the same doctor Dr. Gaceta (NWClinic) for 15 years. My husband recently had the flu. He got such amazing care at emergency. The staff at the ER were great! I can't thank you enough for the great care they provided for my husband!,positive
"Apparently I left my review on the wrong Yelp page, so here I am again...

I love the San Diego VA Health Care System. I've been part of Puget Sound and briefly contemplated Loma Linda when we moved to Twentynine Palms. (Glad I didn't.)

This VA is amazing; except for the Community Care/Choice situation. That sucks hard. 

At this particular VA hospital there's an entire lot of DV/DP parking. Once inside, if you're rated 30% or more (or your visit is for a service connected disability), head in past the lobby and turn right. On that wall is the travel reimbursement forms. If you live (I think) 30mi (one way) from the VA, you get reimbursed $0.41/mi. Of course, you must meet the $18 copay for the month first. BUT, you should still fill out the paperwork regardless as it helps accounting (imo). 

I go to the O'side clinic for my routine care, but all specialty care is here at La Jolla. Parking is always easy. Access from the 5... easy. Everyone is helpful. The only negative people tend to be the disenfranchised veterans. (With good reason, usually.) 

I really have no complaints. All that said--YOU MUST ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF. You should have learned that while in the military, so this shouldn't be anything new.",positive
"Honestly, no one likes going to the hospital or bringing a loved one there but the VA Med Center in La Jolla makes the best of it. Staff are insanely nice, helpful, courteous and empathetic. Every interaction I've had here for my dad has been such a pleasure and we've hit almost every single dept at this location. The ER, specialty clinics, MRI, blood work... you name it and every single part has the same amazing staff to interact with. Its kind of a maze but the greeters in the main lobby are super helpful if you ask for directions etc. I can't say enough good things about this location and honestly all VA med centers in SD.",positive
"My husband is a Vietnam vet. He started with the VA in 2012 when our family insurance With my workplace changed. He has had most of his care at the Loma Linda VA, until we moved closer to San Diego so we go to the VA in La Jolla. His care in both facilities has been thorough and the staff are so kind, and knowledgeable, and the facilities are very very clean. 
I've been a nurse for years , so saying I'm picky is an understatement. The VA is a great organization for men and women  who deserve the best.",positive
"I just had an appointment at the VA Medical Center for my knee and I am posting this so that everyone associated with the VA hospital or patients will know that my experience has been the best ever. From the front entrance into the new parking structure, finally I'm not having to circle around for 15 minutes looking for a parking spot it was so easy in and out. I was then greeted at the front entrance doors by the staff giving out mask and asking the same do you have Covid questions but, they greeted me with a genuine heartfelt smile and a pleasant hello that made me feel good. The facility itself was spotless clean from the grounds to every part of the building  to include the restrooms that sparkled, I could tell the Veteran cleaning staff took  pride in the quality of their work it shows. I had a 9:00 appointment and I was seen promptly at 9:05 by my doctor and a resident Dr in training who ask me all the right questions, he took his time to diagnose and the gave me several courses of action to take. He explained each course of action pros and cons and allowed me to choose, which I did. 
Overall my experience was better than I could ever hope for and as a veteran I am very appreciative of all of the staff for how they treat those who served. I've heard of complaints from other vets at other locations but not here and if there are complaints they are isolated and handled promptly. 
This facility is top notch with a professional staff who are trained to understand the true meaning of customer service. 
Thank you to the VA administration for your efforts in making this one of, if not the best VA Medical Center in the nation.  
Thank you and keep up the good work.",positive
So impressed by the staff and the way the COVID-19 Vaccine administration process was set up!!,positive
"For my first appointment it was a good experience.  The health care workers, check-in attendant, customer service person I encountered are all very professional, helpful, and knowledgeable.  I also noticed the cleanliness of the building, especially the restrooms.  
I felt I was in good care during my visit.",positive
I have been going to the San Diego VA since 2009. I have had two surgeries there. Emergency appendix surgery and breast cancer surgery. I have also received chemotherapy and all my cancer related treatments there. My doctors are truly the best they are awesome. All my experiences there have been excellent!!,positive
"I wanted to jump on here and say Thank you to the VA Hospital ER Staff.  These men and women are heroes.  They were extremely thorough before discharging me.  I went home feeling much better.  Was still in pain but, the lengths these guys go to ensure there is nothing seriously wrong with you is impressive.  Shot out to my doc was Dr. Andrea.   She was very professional and thorough.",positive
"Fast and courteous the modernization of the La Jolla facility has been a long and arduous project and well worth the wait.  I urge all veterans if you are not registered with the VA do so

I just had another appointment had to be a fast courteous great service I was at the mission valley facility",positive
I totally would rather come to the Va hospital after the remodeling  has made this beautiful and very peaceful place. I have considered change PCP to the hospital because it feels a lot cleaner and I am able to everything needed it one place. The clinics are not professional enough and the people I have came across are super rude. Chula Vista clinic to be exact. The only downside is that I will have to travel 40 mins away for any appointment.,positive
"We have been to this hospital few times with the family now, and they always do provide us with the best care. Special shout out to home oxygen clinic and the respiratory department, they always go out of their way to make sure we have everything we need to be as comfortable as we can every step of the way. 
Thank you!",positive
Took a friend here and was very impressed with the staff & service he received.  Seem organized and he knew where every office was located,positive
I've been visiting this hospital a lot recently due to my father's medical condition. The staff and volunteers are exceptional. Eager to assist and help out others is what I've witnessed here. Our AMAZING VETERANS deserve the best in healthcare and I'm seeing that displayed with my father's health team and staff. Keep up the great work and THANK YOU to our Patriots for defending our Freedom!!,positive
"Hey, its the VAMC, it provide free medical treatment to peacetime or/and combat Veterans like myself to come when we are either got injured while we were at active duty or on training commands. 

I came in recently because I had an ongoing medical issues since the injury occurs when I was in active duty.

I got seem fairly quickly and assessed by the doctors here in the Emergency Room in the VAMC.

They explained all procedure to me and let me know the dangers of the medication they prescribe to me. I will be heavily medicated and its not advisable to operate a car.

Appreciate all the Doctors, nurse practitioners come by to check on me when I lay in the ER beds. To ensure my condition didn't developed worst.

It's these quality cares I am thankful for.",positive
"Eugene is the best, he got me the help I needed and was very comfortable to speak to. I voiced my concerns and he handled them like a pro should. The way he handled it all was flawless.",positive
"I don't believe any hospital or business for that matter can rate 100% excellence 100% of the time but what sets some apart from others is some always are striving for it. As far as I'm concerned, San Diego VA Medical staff are those who constantly strive to give vets their excellence of service and character. Are they perfect, no but as a veteran who's been receiving care there, I'm totally satisfied and any shortcomings I've experienced over the years are eclipsed by the great care I've received. And I'm really grateful to them all.",positive
"As it turned out, I spent 67 days here and for the most part enjoyed 3 squares a day. Lost 78 lbs and had a new Aortic Valve installed, adn i am feeling better and better each day. Thank you VA San Diego, you rock especially B pod 3 North.",positive
"This is a shout-out to Kelly, audiology tech who helped me this morning getting my hearing aids functioning like new again . He spent a lot of time giving me some tips on maintenance and ordered an external microphone for me. He is definitely a rock star, IMHO.",positive
"It seems like most folks on here are basing their evaluations on one situation.  I have been using this VA hospital for years and I have gotten what I consider to be fantastic care.  Many of the doctors are residents from local medical schools and they are on top of the latest technology and medical protocols. I have great civilian insurance and I could go anywhere for my care, but I actually PREFER La Jolla VA.  My insurance pays the VA for all but my service-connected issues, and I am happy they get the money. 

I always get the treatment I need (although the parking sucks and ER waits can be affected by triage).  Prescriptions magically show up in the mail on schedule. I use the HealthyEVet web site to order refills and to communicate via email with my provider.

Keep in mind that some people would gripe if they were hung with a silk rope.  And sometimes,YOU might be the problem.  Attitude goes a long way.",positive
"Shout out to VA Hospital in La Jolla for taking good care of our good friend today. 

Everyone from Dr. Ram to Nurse Kerri, super duper kind, nice, compassion, caring, and professional.

The facility is clean. The staff is cheerful, helpful. That's EXACTLY the way I envision our Veterans to be treated.   THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.",positive
"My husband a Vietnam vet is in the process of just having surgery this VA hospital has been amazing I rate it a 5 a
- quality care, professional and VERY caring at every turn - God bless all the staff, doctors and volunteers for jobs well done - thank you",positive
"Thanks to the RN'S in the ER. So friendly, helpfully and overall just awesome. My Bestfriend has kidney stones and had to be taken to the ER. Every staff member just went above and beyond. Thanks guys! 

Clean, professional and No kids.",positive
"People working hard nonstop, taking care of others endlessly while some times taking care of their family when they're not here.... I'm not going to be selfish, because I'm not behind those desks/ walls as long as they have been. Awesome job y'all at the VA!  . For those complaining; Go to another hospital if you feel you're not being attended or apply for a job to help them take care of others who fell like you. No one's forcing you to go to this one, which is free for most services.",positive
"Very simple but thorough pre op for my husband. All involved came to him while we waited for them
",positive
Great care and service every time I come. It is the best VA in San Diego CA. It is better than La Jolla VA for sure!! Maybe because it is smaller and less people go here? Not sure but I def love coming here over all other offices.,positive
"This place has to be my go to medical facility within the VA.  Their staff are not only courteous and polite but very respectful of individuals.  Parking is easy to find thanks to the parking garage and crossing the street is a cinsh with the polite cross guards.  Although they are undergoing construction the place is still very well kept and if you ever get lost there is always a friendly smile there to point you back on track.   I came here two times for treatment in the past and would recommend anyone facing difficulty at the mission valley clinic to come here, at least here they don't have those lousy metal detectors.",positive
"I have NEVER been disappointed in my care at ANY of the VA medical facilities. This includes open heart surgery and ongoing treatment for COPD, and BP, diabetes and the usual aches and pains.
Dr Barry in pulmonary is OUTSTANDING and the cardiac department (I have AFIB) is top notch (nurse Stephanie and crew are great).
If you have a problem with the VA, first look in the mirror. I think you might find the problem looking back at you.",positive
"It took me nearly 15years to see a doctor at the VA. Now that I am in the system I wish I would had done it 15years ago. While there is some expected confusion with doctors and specialists, the over all service is excellent-! You are treated as a person and not a number. They automatically extend you other services that may apply to you without having to specifically request. From the initial in-processing to receiving services is well within a week. Live further than reasonable driving distance? They will find an 'out of provider' close to your home to reduce the stress of driving; as well as provides a shuttle service for those with limited transportation.",positive
Most people just complain just to complain. I've waited for hours a few times at urgent care/ER but I always get seen and taken care of. I've also had surgeries here. People are nice and I like hearing stories from other veterans while waiting.,positive
"My dad is a Vet. He has been coming to the VA hospital to get treatment for his medical condition. All of the doctors and nurses and staff that has worked with our family has been wonderful we are so happy of the service our family is receiving here,  thank you very much.",positive
"This San Diego facility is the best. Ups and downs over the past 35+ years, but I'm always treated with respect. Thank you VA!",positive
"When I was laid up in this hospital a few times, they took such great care of me. This is The BEST hospital in San Diego for veterans.",positive
"had the varicose vein in my left leg ""stripped"" here back in 3/2003. Was lucky enough to stay at a friend's house who lived near the hospital. This was the first time I had ever spent even one night in a hospital. The entire staff here at the LA JOLLA V.A. HOSPITAL treated me so nice. I have been to much fancier hospitals but none have come close to the kindness and efficiency of this V.A. hospital staff.",positive
"Dr. B at in the ER is great! His staff is awesome as well. My questions are always answered, they are professional, and I feel as though my wait was worth it.",positive
Fantastic service. Always in and out of this place with the top service. Never had any issues and even with last minute appointments they alway for me In. Love it here. If you bitch and complain a lot then there is a reason you put 3 stars or below. Be patient and planned and it will be a smooth experience here. Good job guys and girls.,positive
"This 5 star review is for Dr. Botte in Orthopedics and Mike and Mark in the cast room.  As for the rest of you vets and people for vets who have had bad experiences,  I AM WITH YOU.  I wish the leadership of the facility would have a sit down with us and ask us what really goes on in this place when the higher ups aren't around.  They always tell you, patient advocate, patient advocate, patient advocate.  Really, please.  I'm 38, retired USMC infantry and was one of those vets left and forgotten about in a VA facility before.  I have many stories, so I say again.  I AM WITH YOU.  
  
  I have had two surgeries, and possibly need more,  with DR. Botte and both times I have dealt with Mike and Mark in the cast room.  I in fact waited about ten years to start my needed surgeries because I could not find a VA orthopedic surgeon that I felt comfortable with.  Despite all the craziness that goes on with the facility, these individuals have really gone out of their way to help me and reassure me with every visit.  Some people waste air and fill voids, but not these people.  I really believe that these individuals really want to be there and help us.  Thank you Mark and Mike for always letting me vent and express my concerns as a patient in pain.  Real professionals don't always tell you what you want to hear, and are not always supposed to agree with you.   By the way, to other Dr's, please spend more time with Mike and Mark discussing each patents needs.  I have seen them have to recast patients because the cast wasn't high enough, low enough, or at a certain perfect or imperfect angle.  NOT due to Mike or Marks incorrect casting.  Dr. Botte really takes his time, despite his facility demands.  I watch other DR's move too quickly in and out of the cast room.  We are not fast food, we are patients.  Medical CARE means CARE.  

   Thank you again to DR. Botte and MIke and Mark in the cast room.  You are part of a few individuals that I would gladly stand the watch with.  Good luck and Semper Fi.",positive
Great service! Much better experience than another California location a few years back.,positive
"Our family has had the BEST experience here obtaining care for my Dad. Everyone, from the janitorial staff, valet, pharmacy, primary care, RN's, doctors, diabetes educators, MRI, surgical staff, etc. has been so kind and helpful! I appreciate their thoroughness and follow-thru. GREAT JOB to you all and KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!! :)",positive
