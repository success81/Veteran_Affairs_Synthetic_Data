"The medical team that provides my healthcare led by Dr. Gabuzda of the Mission Valley Clinic is topnotch.  Caring, professional, and looking out for my welfare.  I recently was introduced to VTS  (Veterans Transportation Services) which has provided rides to and from my residence to the VAMC.  Thank you VA",positive
"The VA has gotten SO much better over the years, in my opinion. The price is right, the people are always very friendly and supportive, and I even get a kick out of all the cool pictures on the walls leading in (from a variety of wars and services). Parking is always a breeze, and I've found that the wait times aren't NEARLY as long as they were just 10 years ago. They've also made things easier, like mailing your meds to you - so you don't have to rush over to the pharmacy after work and hope that you make it in time. The billing system is easy to keep track of, and I pay my bills online. Since you don't have to pay a premium (and I'm just a 10 year submarine vet, by the way), it really is very inexpensive compared to what my company has to offer. Thank you, everybody at the VA - for all you do for veterans.",positive
I have alway been treated with kindness and respect here. The doctors are very through. When i had my surgery I was asked at least 6 time to resite my name date of birth and ssn. The parking was no problem for me because I ride a motorcycle. I do agree the parking for car really sucks.,positive
"By far the best medical service for vets. All of the other va offices have doctors who are not that great, but the hospital is best.",positive
"If you have been in the military you know it's ""hurry up and wait"".  If you need help there is a very easy way to get it.  Go to the patient advocates office.  They do help.

I have had two major surgeries in the last year.  The orthopedic department performed a triple fusion of my lower back the first of July 2010.  The middle of September I bought a motorcycle in Colorado and drove it to Oklahoma before returning to San Diego.

Six weeks ago the  orthopedic department replaced my knee.  Two weeks ago I was back on my bike.  Staff can be trying but if you need orthopedic help I cannot give them a high enough rating.  Yes they are overworked and understaffed but these two men care.

The highest complement I can give them is this.  They give you their education and let you decide what to do in your situation.  Competent is an understatement they were excellent.

Thank you men, you took really great care of me.

If you want to know who they are.  Go in and tell them this story and I'm sure you will be able to find them.

My primary care is also great!  She cares and does all she can.  If you don't like your primary care doc you can change to another.",positive
I get all my medical care here.  And I have to say I always receive great care even though I might have to wait a little time after my scheduled appt. time.,positive
"I pretty much spent 6 to 7 days here per month for almost 2 years while my father was going through his battle with cancer. The hospital as a whole gave him the best treatment and care we could ever ask for and his oncologist was in my opinion a great person and was really born to be in the field that he is in.  Between weekly doctor visits, late night ER runs (we live up in Oceanside) and chemo/zometa treatments every 3 weeks. We became pretty much known there. My father was able to get the best and latest of treatments suitable for him (prostate cancer with mets to the bones, lymph nodes). Even when the situation became grim, my father was the one given the choice in his treatment. No recommendations of stopping his fight or breaking his strong will to live. After 17 cycles of chemotherapy it was his choice while AT a chemo appointment not to go through with the drip that day. He was feeling his worst and didn't want to go through additional effects of the chemo. They scheduled another appointment for him at his next 3 week mark and said if he felt up to coming in he'd be more than welcome to keeping his drive and hope alive even though we all knew the inevitable was coming. Myself, my father, and his Dr were emotional and ultimately we were then offered in home hospice care which my father reluctantly accepted. A day after what would have been his next chemo treatment my father passed away at home with family and lots of love. I feel that they let my father fight as long as he could and he had the final say all the way until the end. He went when he was ready and the way he wanted. Overall the VA Medical Center in La Jolla sure can be overcrowded at times and the stress of SOME employees is apparent, but considering how busy they are and some of the creepy older vets that hang around, they are exceptional at accommodating and the Drs (Beale) are above par imho.  Thank you for making the last few months of my fathers life full of hope and listening rather than directing. It truly was a once in a lifetime experience and everytime I drive by I always remember the warmth we were shown and think of how my father was shown respect and compassion throughout his fight.. RIP Captain Clifford Arnold, beloved father of mine.",positive
"have been there three times in the last month my husband has PTSD that he got while serving in the Navy. The staff nurses, superb best service I'm so grateful for this place",positive
"I go to this Hospital OFTEN, probably 20-30 visits a year. My Dad was a WWII vet and we utilize this facility for all his medical needs. EVERYONE at this hospital is fantastic. This is from the cafeteria people, coffee cart, store, nurses, Doctors, appoint setters, pharmacy, every department and every person we have encountered are the nicest people and there to ensure your visit is memorable. My Dad gets first rate care and the interactions with all personnel is red carpet. He has been to other VA facilities in New York and Arizona and they pale in comparison.  Every time we come to the La Jolla VA he marvels at the care (and competency of the personnel) he receives. You have no idea how lucky you are to be working for one of the finest facilities in the Nation.

Ramsey S you sound like one of those people who are never satisfied. Because you are a worker, your job is do what you are asked, that is what you are paid for.  Your job is not to dissect reasons and processes. If it were, you would be in that position, you are not. You sound like the person that life is half empty, not half full, you are criticizing processes that are put into place for reasons you don't need to know, but are to follow to comply with regulations, law, compliance, ease, continuity in charts, etc. You have no idea of why certain things are asked of you, as your employer has mandated, your job is to follow their rules.  If you don't like it, go find another job, the VA system I know does not need people like you. Your job was being done before you were hired and will be done after you leave. There is no utopia here on earth, but maybe you need to go and find your utopia in a job.  Good luck.",positive
The doctors and nurses in the ER were amazing. They treated my brother with respect and kindness. They worked quickly and thoroughly to get him the medical care he needed.  They were also very kind to our family.,positive
"I recommend going here. For all the bad press that the VA gets, I felt that the physicians, nurses, and staff here were extremely professional, courteous, responsive, and willing help. I came to the ER here for chest pains and was admitted to the hospital for tests and observation. I was treated courteously and received quality basic medical care without the fear of having to file for bankruptcy afterwards. The worst part was the long initial wait to be seen in the ER when I first arrived but is to be expected.",positive
"I've only ever heard bad things about the VA, but since getting my DD214, I've had nothing but amazing visits to the Nashville VA. Everyone from front desk staff to the doctors are so kind, funny and knowledgeable. I've been going a lot lately due to health issues, but they have made this experience less painful. Also it's very clean, lots of parking and easy to navigate. Thank you to all working at the VA! Especially Renee in Firm A (the sweetest woman ever).",positive
"I went on a Saturday. My mind was blown by their great professionalism and kindness. The facility was beautiful and near empty on the weekend. Everyone was nice and knowledgeable which was nice as a prior Corpsman it was nice to talk with them all. All in all I had a full appointment, set up future care, full lab panel, went back and asked questions about getting an X-ray, then hit up the pharmacy for multiple medications.. In and out in just a hour.. Cant beat it! 

I heard it's a longer wait on the week days but still, pretty great service and nothing like the phone center who actually yelled at me.",positive
"admit to going to this Washington D.C, branch of the Veterans Affair center.  I'm blessed to be in great physical health, but I admit to coming her for counseling that pertains to dealing with my mild depression (which I actually found out back in 2012 may be partially inherited from my biological mother's side), However, I feel comfortable going to this center because the service specialists are often courteous and I'm fortunate in being able to obtain the counseling for free due to me being a military veteran female. Last, but not least, they are often willing to work around employment schedules and are understanding in allowing other appointment opportunities in case a person did not make it to their original chosen appointment.",positive
"Had my eye appointment yesterday and was very satisfied with the service I received. 

The doctor had some additional testing done to verify the diagnosis, consulted with other physicians as to the best treatment plan and took time to listen to my concerns and questions!

I feel much better today with the treatment plan, and medications given.",positive
"Phoenix VA is the shining turd of the VA system. Remember all the wait listed veterans that died, yeah that was the Phoenix VA. This is the most dysfunctional of all the VA locations. The mental health clinic here doesn't give two cares about you as a patient. Stay away stay far away. I get free VA medical and still I pay monthly for private insurance. The mental health clinic may act like they care but trust me they don't. They don't call to talk to patience when outside doctors ask for consults they take the easy way out every time. They don't have your health in mind they only care about themselves. Good luck getting an appointment for when you need. They will give you meds that can't refill and say meet me in 30 days. Then when you get to the front the office only have appointments 45 days out, never when you need them. So that's 15 days without the meds you need. Their answer to this problem? Oh simply come into the walk in clinic. What they don't tell you is you arrive for the walk in clinic only to sit and wait for multiple hours to wait and see someone. If you actually have a career this isn't possible.   It's sad how often I've been screwed over by this VA system. Go elsewhere you owe it to yourself. No matter how many times the VA is reformed it still continues to be a terrible terrible place for veterans to receive care. Multiple multiple patients have died waiting to see doctors here.  Dr Lin in the Mental health clinic is the worst of them all. He herds the patients thru like cattle and doesn't care to treat you like a real human. He will make decisions regarding patient care with outside doctors without even consulting the patient. Stay away your just a number to him not a real person.",negative
"In a nutshell, just a very dangerous place to go to or even have to deal with. I have been out of my medications (including my high blood pressure meds), for over a month now and have been unable to get refills. After over a dozen inquiries concerning status, all I get from them is ""we've sent your refill request to your primary physician (Dr. Buckle) and he will contact you"". Over the last 4-5 weeks, that's the only reply I have ever received. I'm a disabled combat Vietnam vet and am proud of my service to my country, but I am ashamed of the unsatisfactory actions used by the Phoenix VA. I'm considering getting a physician in the private sector and sever my association with the VA.

P.S. I wonder if any of the VA physicians get a guilty conscience when they cash their paycheck. I doubt it.",negative
"This absolutely the worst Hospital or medical system to deal with.  Supposedly things have changed after the big issues they had here. Here I am again 9 years later and nothing has changed. I advise going anywhere other than here.  

This place treats Vets like crap and genuinely don't care.  I could list how awful it is but the list would go on and on.",negative
"Recently moved to Phoenix from Seattle and had to get everything transferred over. What a huge regret! The Phoenix VA system is the worst I have encountered. They treat the veterans like cattle. Here's what stood out to me in the 4.5 hours I was there.
- Staff park in the patient parking area, forcing patients to park further away. 
- Each staff member I encountered, besides enrollment, had a horrible attitude and treated people like crap.
- Most of their systems don't communicate to each other, causing a ton of run around with no purpose.
- The wait times are outrageous. And it doesn't matter which department.
- Mental health personnel treat patients like criminals. I left wondering what I did wrong to be treated so awful. Being there gave me extreme anxiety, which in theory it's supposed to do the opposite.
- The staff makes you feel insignificant by the way they talk and treat you.

Now I see why so many veterans end up dying while waiting for help from the Phoenix VA. I genuinely felt like I was going to have a breakdown while I was there being tossed from one department to the next. 

I miss the Seattle VA system. Phoenix can learn a thing or two about customer service and patient care.",negative
Absolutely the biggest joke.  Not sure how they even call this a hospital.  Nobody knows what's going on there and takes weeks to get an appointment only to no even be see by a dr at all.  This is not a hospital it's a funeral home.  Nobody there seems to give 2 shits if someone needs help or getting things done in a timely matter.  It is a helpless feeling this is the only Avenue you have and know it leads to nowhere.  Our vets deserve better.  It's a shame the va is budgeted at about 200 billion dollars a year and this is the results.  Complete broken system. They should do completely away with the va and just provide vets free healthcare at any facility of their choice instead of only having 1 choice,negative
"It just took me 22 days and 5 calls to get a simple allergy medicine renewed. After 4 calls to leave messages for my doctor, I finally had to report him to the Patient Advocate. Even then, no one bothered to let me know he had finally done it on Friday after I had gone to work and it was too late for me to go online and order it to be sent. Now, without this prescription nasal spray for so long, I have gotten a sinus infection and I am struggling to prevent it from becoming bronchitis and possible pneumonia. I still have to wait several days to get it in the mail.
Phoenix VA is a sorry excuse for medical care because they DON'T CARE. All you get there is ignored, lied to, and talked over when you try to communicate with them. I seriously hope this is the worst VA system, because if there is one worse, then God help the vets going there.",negative
"Once again another awful review. I have tried for two weeks to get an appointment to dermatology due to outside medical biopsy diagnoses squamous Carcinoma and recommended multiple Mohs surgery ASAP to remove. I reached out immediately to VA for second opinion and to see dermatology. Dermatology said I have to go through my primary care. Primary care can't book me an appointment so the nurse said bring your diagnosis and walk in and I'll get you seen by primary care Northeast clinic Scottsdale. I arrived with all docs and guess what the doc got in a verbal Fight with nurse and walked out the day I was there.   The nurse who helped me said she would just hold my paperwork to see if and when he gets back. All the while I am hoping the cancer is slow growing on my face so these idiots can figure out how to read a biopsy and call dermatology immediately. 
Seems so simple.  It's so sad to think how many vets I. Much more advanced phases than mine with any medical conditions have received sub par care from this broken system.  I have found the easiest way sadly to get seen is to go to ER and tax and overwhelm that system.",negative
horrible parking! i arrived here at 1020 for an appointment at 1100. couldnt park anywhere!!! finally found one after 20 mins checked in 2 mins before my appointment. and now im still waiting because of the fucking parking.. its 1203..,negative
"It is the most frightening and disorganized atmosphere for me to enter. The staff lie about notifying a person. When there's an issue, they hand off the patient to someone else. Even heard one staffer literally say, But it's not my job. When he was told about making a courtesy call. The only good part of the experience is the volunteers who greet you at the door. They expect you to do their foot work which for a veteran with a walker to cross cross the facility is unacceptable in my book. If I could take my son in law ANYWHERE else, I would and wouldn't look back. All of our veterans deserve better care than what is handed out here. as for parking? Good luck with that. I once circled their lots for 40 min before I finally got one. While it looks like they have a lot of handicapped parking spaces, expect them all to be full. Oh, and clear your schedule for the day. Even if your appointment is in the am. You are going to be there for a really long while while you wait for them to ""get around"" to your soldier. In the private sector, maximum wait for my daughter to have a colonoscopy was an hour. I got here with my son in law at 7am to get him checked in. They finally got around to seeing him at 9:10am. Seriously? His appointment was 8am. Either port these patients out to the private sector so they can get the level of care they need with the dignity that all of the rest of us get in the private sector. This is unacceptable as it currently is.",negative
"What a group of incompetent idiots who work here! My husband goes to get blood drawn every 3 months and it is always an ordeal. Multiple pokes, multiple bruises. I am an RN and I know it is not that difficult! Funny thing is, when he goes to Sonora or Labcorp, no problem. I know there are students at VA, and I was a student at one time, but even the staff can't do their job!",negative
"I've never been to a worse medical facility in my life. Over two hour wait EVERY TIME. I came in to the er one specific time for severe back pain due to fractures, the ""Dr"" was a tall goofy Fuck with blonde hair, he accused me of being a liar and implying I was hunting for pill prescriptions even tho I hadn't had any meds for over a year and a half, I'm glad my wife was there so I have someone who was by my side to verify what that Fuck said. Parking is terrible the employees are fucking lazy and act like YOU'RE the problem not the system. Fuck the va.  Fuck the employees. And a huge FUCK YOU to the drs. You should be fucking embarrassed of yourselves.",negative
I've never had to wait less than an hour and up 3 hours to been seen by doctor for my appointment. Dedicated 6 years of my life to country to sit around and wait hours. Not to mention the time it takes to get appointments. Along with a botched surgery the doctor couldn't even give me any statistics on the healing process.,negative
"Worst customer service ever!  Completely disgusted with the service received at this VA hospital...Operators blind transfer you to other departments that hang up on you...First time registering?  Expect to be put on a 3 to 6 month waiting list just to talk to someone to set up an appointment no matter how bad you need to see a DR..

Veterans DESERVE better than this!!",negative
"Had an Appointment on 1/12/21 @ 1000 am, got there at 915, Was stopped at gate that entire parking area on west was closed?. Also parking Garage closed everyone had to park on the east side so here are lets say 500 looking for parking and only 300 slots. Really so I parked of site finally and was of course late to my Appointment. Yes this is the great VA taking care of the veteran. I really feel the Memphis VA is the WORST VA I have ever dealt with. Some of the employees are great and some would not help you if your life depended on it. The parking situation has to be the biggest CF I have ever seen. 
Thanks VA Memphis for caring about the Vet.",negative
I have been waiting for over eight hours to be seen. I feel worse now than when I got here. The VA should be ashamed of the service we receive here as Veterans. They have taken my vitals three times and I have been shifted to three different locations. Not one time have I seen a Doctor. This is the worst experience EVER and they should be FINED! Absolutely no rating from me. Not even a one star!,negative
Most of the staff who works there are miserable and disrespectful.  I've been going there since 2005 and I see mostly the same staff who treat you more as a number than a patient.  My primary doctor basically asked me what do I want as far as drugs this place is unprofessional and corrupt just as much as the city of Memphis TN is.  I'm in the process of changing doctors but the ones I have seen are not compassionate nor do they communicate with you or work in harm reduction.  I have several chronic illnesses and disability when I did have insurance the private doctors and specialist are way better I guess you get what you pay for and for this facility since it is government funded and the doctors can't get a real job outside the va or their own practice they take it out on everyone else oh and one last thing I know these doctors write narcotics for each other if you've seen a doctor you know what I'm talking about they think they are GOD this place is evil most of the staff here do not like working and you will find that out for yourself.  God Bless.,negative
